<h3>The Clash of Arms.</h3>

<p class="normal">In this stirring romance of the seventeenth century the reader
shares the adventures of an English officer who serves under Turenne in his
German campaigns. The author has written an engrossing story of love and war.</p>
<br>

<h3>Denounced.</h3>

<p class="normal">&quot;The author of 'Denounced' is second to none in the romantic
recounting of the tales of earlier days. A story of the critical times of the
vagrant and ambitious Charles I, it is so replete with incident and realistic
happenings that one seems translated to the very scenes and days of that
troublous era in English history. The interest throughout is of that absorbing
and magnetic kind that holds one's attention closely from the first chapter to
the last.&quot;--<i>Boston Courier</i>.</p>
<br>

<h3>In the Day of Adversity</h3>

<p class="normal">&quot;We do not hesitate to declare that Mr. Bloundelle-Burton's
new romance will be very hard to beat in its own particular line. . . . Mr.
Burton's creative skill is of the kind which must fascinate those who revel in
the narratives of Stevenson, Rider Haggard, and Stanley Weyman. Even the author
of 'A Gentleman of France' has not surpassed the writer of 'In the Day of
Adversity' in the moving interest of his tale.&quot;--<i>St. James's Gazette</i>.</p>

<h5>AWAITING THE TRAVELLER.</h5>

<p class="normal">With all the pomp and ceremony that should accompany the dying
hours of a great lady of France, the Princesse de Rochebazon--Marquise du Gast
d'Ançilly, Comtesse de Montrachet, Baronne de Beauvilliers, and possessor of
many other titles, as well as the right to the tabouret--drew near her end.</p>

<p class="normal">A great lady of France, yet a woman against whom scandal had
never breathed a word; a woman whose name had never been coupled with that of
any courtier in a manner disadvantageous to her fame, but who instead, since
first she came into the family a bride, had always been spoken highly of. As a
saint by some--nay, by many; as a Christian by all; as a good servant of the
Church. Now, the priests said, she was about to reap her reward in another
existence, where her exalted rank would count as nothing and the good deeds of
her life as everything.</p>

<p class="normal">Below, in the courtyard of her great hotel--which was situated
in the Rue Champfleury, still called by many La Rue Honteuse because of what had
gone on in that street hundreds of years before--the huge Suisse stood at the
open gateway, leaning on his silver-headed cane, which he no longer dared to
thump vigorously on the ground for fear of disturbing his dying mistress, stood
and gazed forth into the long though narrow street. Perhaps to see that none
intruded within the crimson cord set in front of the  <i>porte-cochère</i> of
the Hôtel de Rochebazon; perhaps to observe--with that pride which the menial
takes in the greatness of his employers--how all the noble and illustrious
callers on his mistress had to leave their coaches and their chairs outside of
that barrier, and advance on foot for some yards along the filthy  <i>chaussée</i>
ere they could enter the courtyard; also, perhaps, to tell himself, with a warm
glow of satisfaction, that none below royalty who had ever approached their end
in Paris had been inquired after by more illustrious visitors.</p>

<p class="normal">Above, in the room where the princess lay dying--yet with all
her faculties about her, and with, though maybe she hardly thought so, a great
deal of vitality still left in her body--everything presented the appearance of
belonging to one of wealth and position. The apartment was the bed chamber in
which none but the chiefs of the house of de Rochebazon were ever permitted to
lie; the bed, of great splendour and vast antiquity, was the bed in which
countless de Beauvilliers and Montrachets and du Gast d'Ançillys and de
Rochebazons had been born and died. A bed with a  <i>ruelle</i> around it as
handsome in its velvet and gold lace and gilt pilasters as the  <i>ruelle</i> of  <i>
Le Dieudonné</i> himself--for the de Rochebazons assumed, and were allowed to
assume without protest, many of the royal attributes and peculiarities--a bed
standing upon a raised platform, or rostrum, as though the parquet floor was not
exalted enough to come into contact with the legs of the couch on which the
rulers of the house stretched their illustrious limbs.</p>

<p class="normal">In the room itself all was done that could be done to make it
a fitting apartment for those heads of this great family. Arras and tapestry
hung on the walls, representing religious scenes, battle scenes, hawking and
hunting scenes; upon the uncovered portions of the wainscot were paintings of
members who had borne at different times the different names of the family; on  <i>
plaques</i> in other places were miniatures and pictures by Bordier and Petitot,
Mignard and Le Brun. Also, although 'twas autumn now, all about the great
chamber were placed bowls of flowers and ferns and grasses. These brightened not
only the room, but sweetened it as well, and mingled their pure perfume with the
less pure Pulvilio and  <i>Bouquet du Roi</i> with which the air was
impregnated.</p>

<p class="normal">In silvery tones a masterpiece of Fromantil's struck far down
the room, over the mantelshelf of the huge fireplace, by the side of which a
monk sat reading his breviary, and as it did so the princess, lying on her bed,
opened her eyes--large, blue-gray eyes, the brightness of which age had no power
to quench, nor would have till she was dead--and spoke to a girl seated outside
the  <i>ruelle</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What hour was that, Manon? Three or four?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Three, Madame la Princesse,&quot; the other answered, rising and
passing under the bar to her mistress.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The day is fair,&quot; the dying aristocrat said, letting her eyes
glance toward the windows, through the heavy lace curtains of which the sun's
rays strayed. &quot;Fair. There is nothing to impede his journey. He should be here
to-night. He must have crossed from England yesterday, must he not?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should suppose so, madame. This is Friday. Your courier
left for London last Sunday. It is certain Monsieur Ashurst must be very near
Paris now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, Manon! Monsieur Ashurst! Monsieur Ashurst! I would,
instead, he were Monsieur de Beauvilliers. Then--then----&quot; She broke off in what
she had been about to say and bade the girl go tell the holy father he might
leave the room, might walk in the garden if he chose, and see if there were any
roses left. His services were not now required; if she could judge by her
feelings, her death was not to be yet. Send him away, she gave order.</p>

<p class="normal">Obedient to her commands--was she not a patroness of all the
religious foundations in and around Paris, as well as a magnificent
benefactress?--the monk departed. Then the Princesse de Rochebazon continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If he were not Monsieur Ashurst, but were instead of my
husband's side, the de Rochebazons would not have come to an end--to an end. My
God! why is he not a de Beauvilliers? Yet, had he been, I might not have loved
him as I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Tis pity, madame,&quot; the girl said. &quot;Yet even as it is----&quot;
then paused, breaking off.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Even as it is,' you would say, 'he will inherit much--much
of the de Rochebazon fortune.' Yes, 'tis true. He will be well provided for.
After the Church--that first. Also you, Manon, are remembered.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame!&quot; the girl exclaimed softly, gratefully. Then went on,
while as she spoke the tears stood in her eyes. &quot;You have been always very good
to me, oh! so good, so good, as ever and to all. What shall we do? What shall we
do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, weep not. And--and--'Good!' Never say that. I----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A tap, gentle as became the sick room, was heard at the door,
whereupon the girl, drying her eyes, went down to where it opened, and after a
whispered word with some domestic outside, returned to the bed and, standing
outside the  <i>ruelle</i>, said, &quot;Madame is here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Again! To-day! She is very thoughtful. Let her be brought to
me at once. And, Manon, we will be alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, Madame la Princesse,&quot; whereupon, bowing, she left her
mistress, going once more toward the door, at which she waited until steps were
heard outside, when she opened it wide and courtesied lowly and reverently
before the woman who had been spoken of as &quot;Madame,&quot; and who now came in.</p>

<p class="normal">A lady well advanced in years, having the appearance of being
about seventy, yet looking almost more, since the sumptuous black in which she
was arrayed seemed by its fashion to be suitable to an older woman than even she
was--a lady stately enough, though not tall, with a white complexion and worn
features, eyes that were piercing though not dark, a mouth in which there were
few teeth left, those that still remained being black and discoloured.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Aurore,&quot; she said, advancing to the bedside and passing
within the
<i>ruelle</i>, a bar of which had been lifted by the attendant ere she went out,
&quot;Aurore, I thank our Heavenly Father that he has not yet thought fit to take you
to himself. I--I--was very desirous of seeing you again before we meet in
Heaven--as I pray we shall ere long.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame,&quot; the princess said, her voice calm and, for one
reaching her end, marvellously clear and distinct, &quot;to see you must always be a
gratification to me, even in my extremity. Madame----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Cease this form of address,&quot; the other said, seating herself
as she did so in a low chair by the side of the great bed. &quot;There is no
necessity for ceremony. We have always been friends, going hand in hand in God's
work since--long ago--since you were wife to the Baron de Beauvilliers and with
a greater position still to come; since I was Madame Scarron only, with little
thought of ever being a----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Queen!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay! Never that. A king's wife--but no queen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It rested with you. The acknowledgment might have been
forthcoming had you desired it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Even so. Only it was best to--to--let matters remain as they
are.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">So far as one so feeble as the princess now was could do so,
she bent her head acquiescingly; doubtless she knew also that it was best that
this woman should never be an acknowledged queen. She had not been a brilliant
figure of the court of France for fifty years without being aware of all that
was said, all that was whispered of Françoise d'Aubigné ere she found
religion--as well as favour in the eyes of the king! Also, all that was
whispered after that favour was found. There were a thousand tongues for ever
wagging, as well as innumerable pens--the pen of De Sevignés to hint, the pens
of Rabutins and Tallement des Réaux to speak plainly. Also her first lover was
remembered and spoken of with many a courtier's tongue thrust in his, or her,
cheek.</p>

<p class="normal">But now--now! she posed as God's vicegerent in France.
Religion, even God himself, as some said bitterly, had been taken under her
patronage; the king trembled for his soul as she worked on the fears of his
mind, and Jansenists, Calvinists, Huguenots had been driven forth by hundreds of
thousands to other lands, or, remaining in France, had been dragooned, sent to
the galleys, the wheel, and the flames. The &quot;<i>femme fameuse et funeste</i>&quot;
was the greatest living saint in Europe.</p>

<p class="normal">And as a saint, a patroness of the Holy Roman Church, she came
now to visit the Princesse de Rochebazon once more ere she died.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Aurore,&quot; she said, a moment later, &quot;I have come to you again,
hoping to find you not yet gone before me; because--because--oh, Aurore! to--to
plead once more for the sacred cause of our Church; to beseech you to consider
what you are about to do. Think! Think! You have worked so much good for that
Church--yet you may do more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;More!&quot; the dying woman said, her clear, bright eyes fixed
full blaze upon the other. &quot;Madame--well, Françoise, since you insist--what more
can I do? There is no de Rochebazon succeeding to title or estate, the power to
will the latter, and--and all the movables, the  <i>argent comptant</i>, is
mine. And it is done. Beyond a few gifts to those who have served me, beyond
what I have saved from that which is not justly mine, the Church will have
all--all! Can it demand further?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Tis that, 'tis that, Aurore! What you have saved from that
which is most justly yours? 'Tis that! You told me,&quot; and now her voice, never
loud, sank almost to a whisper, as though she feared that even in this vast room
there might still be some who could overhear her, &quot;that to this young man, this
Martin Ashurst--this  <i>Anglais</i>--you have left those savings. A noble
heritage, five hundred thousand pistoles. Oh, Aurore! Aurore! think, think! it
is French money, and he is--English----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is my own flesh and blood,&quot; the other interjected. &quot;My
brother's child! And he is of our Church!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That alone redeems it. Yet think of all our Church, here in
this France of ours, needs. Money to extirpate the heretics--some can even be  <i>
bought</i> with money, they say; in the  <i>Midi</i> there are those who will
adopt our religion for a handful of Louis d'ors----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They must have changed since their grandfather's days!--since
La Rochelle!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They  <i>have</i> changed, though--Vengeance confound and
crush them!--some are still obstinate. But, Aurore, listen. This young man, this
nephew, needs not the money. He is provided for, will be provided for in his own
land. He will do well--go far under the heretic, Anne. Oh, Aurore, he is your
flesh and blood, I know. 'Tis but nature that you should benefit him--yet not so
much, not so much. God is before man--before all earthly relations.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is my brother's child,&quot; the Princesse de Rochebazon
repeated. &quot;And I loved that brother. Also this one has been my care----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know, I know! Supported, educated by you, given money
hourly to squander in waste. Yet I speak not against that; he is of your race.
But now you will give him all this--so great a sum! And France needs money.
Aurore,&quot; she cried, &quot;do you know that our--that Louis'--coffers are empty? The
wars, the buildings, the pomps and vanities, the awful prodigalities of the
court have left those coffers bare. And money is needed so, needed
so--especially for the work of the Church--needed so much!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And she almost wrung her hands as thus she pleaded. Yet again
the dying aristocrat murmured: &quot;My own flesh and blood. Also of our faith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Exhausted by her own efforts, the De Maintenon--the Curse of
France! as many had termed her--seemed now to desist, to be beaten back by the
words of the princess. Then suddenly seemed also roused to fresh excitement as
the other spoke again--excitement mixed this time with anger, as testified by
the glances her eyes shot forth. For the dying woman had continued: &quot;Though I
provide for him I must tell him the truth--tell all. I can not die with a lie on
my lips--in my heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Aurore!&quot; she exclaimed--had she not been a king's wife, had
this not been a sick-room, it might almost have seemed that she screamed at the
other--&quot;Aurore, your brain is gone. You are mad. Tell him all, and lead to
further evil to our Church. Aurore, for God's sake say this is a fantasy of your
mind. Why,&quot; she exclaimed, her passion mounting with her thoughts, &quot;why should
you, a stranger to France, a woman raised by marriage to your high position,
bring scandal on the name of a noble family--reveal secrets that have slumbered
for years?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can not die,&quot; the other repeated, &quot;with the truth hidden.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The truth,&quot; Madame de Maintenon muttered through her
discoloured teeth, &quot;the truth! What has the truth to do with--what account is it
when set against our faith! Aurore, in the name of that faith, recall your
words, your resolve.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But the dying woman was unshaken. Even the other, whose
influence terrified all France, could not affright her--perhaps because the
princess knew that henceforth she had to answer to a greater than she.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must confess it to him--I must--I must!&quot; she murmured
faintly. &quot;I must. I can not die with such a secret in my heart.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_02" href="#div1Ref_02">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<h5>THE TRAVELLER FROM ENGLAND.</h5>

<p class="normal">A great  <i>Berline à quatre chevaux</i> halted at the North
Gate outside Paris, and the young man seated within the carriage let down the
window and prepared to once more answer all the questions that would be put to
him. Yet he also thanked Heaven, in a somewhat wearied manner, that this must be
the last of it. After that he would be in Paris, with nothing before him but to
drive as fast as might be to the Rue Champfleury, known long ago as La Rue
Honteuse.</p>

<p class="normal">Then the formula began once more, was repeated and gone
through with, precisely in the same manner as it had been gone through with at
Boulogne, where he had landed, at Amiens, Abbeville, and half a dozen other
towns and villages.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur's name?&quot; asked the  <i>guet</i>, respectfully
enough, while as each answer was made he glanced at the passport handed to him
and countersigned by the Ambassador to England from &quot;Louis, Roi de France et de
Navarre, etc.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Martin Ashurst.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Country?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;England.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Position?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Gentleman. Also----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But here he found that no more explanation whatever was
required from him. Precisely as he had found it all along the road, whenever the
inquiring eyes of warders or  <i>guets</i> or gatekeepers (in some cases
soldiers) had lit upon one of the many statements appended to his passport--the
statement that Monsieur Ashurst was nephew to &quot;Madame la Princesse de
Rochebazon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Passez, monsieur,&quot; said the man, as all the other men had
said on seeing this, and saluting as all the other men had saluted; after which,
with a direction to the coachman to proceed, he retired into his room in the
gatehouse.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The last, thank God,&quot; the occupant of the Berline muttered,
&quot;the last. It has been wearisome, but, well, it is over. Now for my aunt.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In spite of his weariness incurred by an unhalting journey
from London, in which sleep could only be obtained by snatches here and there,
in spite of the dust along the highroads both of England and France having
discoloured his scarlet coat and tarnished his gold lacings and rendered dirty
his Valenciennes cravat, as well as having turned the whiteness of his wig to a
dirty yellowish brown, Martin Ashurst presented an attractive appearance. His
features were handsome and manly, clear-cut and aristocratic--Madame la
Princesse de Rochebazon, once Aurora Ashurst, had herself possessed the same
features when young--his figure was slight, yet strong and well knit, his whole
appearance satisfactory. Also he bore about him those indefinable traits which
mark the gentleman, which, perhaps, it may be said without offence to others,
mark and distinguish the English gentleman particularly. A certain calm, a
self-contained air, a lack of perception of the existence of those who were
unknown to him, and thereby without his ken, distinguished Martin Ashurst as it
has always distinguished so many of the well-bred of our land.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet his life had not been all passed in England, the first
fifteen years of it being, indeed, spent in France under the patronage of the
aunt to whom the  <i>Berline à quatre chevaux</i> was now bearing him as fast as
four heavy Flanders roadsters could drag it.</p>

<p class="normal">Gabriel Ashurst, his father, and Gabriel's sister Aurora, had
been two among the hundreds of Royalists who, in the year 1647, were taken by
their parents to France as soon as it was possible to escape out of England and
from the clutches of the Parliamentarians. Then, in France, in Paris, had begun
for them that long career of exile against which so many of the followers of the
Stuarts had repined so much at first, and which, in due course, so many had come
to like and, in some cases, to appreciate. Also there had come to this exiled
family a splendid piece of good fortune, the like of which did not fall often in
the way of English exiles. Aurora Ashurst, a girl of twenty, had won the heart
of Henri de Beauvilliers, then Baron de Beauvilliers, but with, before him in
the near future, the titles and wealth and great positions of Comte de
Montrachet, Marquis du Gast d'Ançilly, and Prince de Rochebazon, for the head of
the house who held them all was near his end; they were almost within the grasp
of Henri, as he stood at the altar with his English bride. Three months after
their marriage they were his.</p>

<p class="normal">Time passed. Gabriel married, as well as his sister, his wife
being a countrywoman of his own, also in exile with her family. Cromwell died,
the Stuarts were restored. Then Gabriel and his wife returned to England, but
the lad, Martin, was left in charge of the Princesse de Rochebazon, who had
become by now a childless widow--was, indeed, almost adopted by her. It was true
she could not make him heir to the great titles--those must die out!--but at
least she could provide for him, and she set about doing it. The whole control
of the de Rochebazon wealth was hers to do what she pleased with; she might, if
she had desired, have left their châteaux, their woods and forests in half a
dozen provinces, their hotel in the Rue Champfleury--everything, to him. Only,
because she was a just woman and a religious, she would not do that, recognising
that the wealth accumulated by generations of French nobles ought not in common
honesty to go to one who had no tie of blood with them and who belonged to a
land which was almost always at war with France. Therefore, urged partly by the
promptings of her own heart and deep Catholic feelings, partly by the promptings
of a priest, and partly by those of the De Maintenon, as well as by a whispered
hint in the soft courtly tones of  <i>le Roi Soleil</i>, now cowering under the
awful terrors that too often assail the self-righteous, she left all the wealth
of the heirless De Rochebazons to the Church, reserving only for Martin Ashurst
the fortune she had saved out of her private purse.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet 'twas a fortune which would make him rich for life, place
him on a high pinnacle in either France or England, cause women either at St.
James's or Versailles to angle for him, and throw aside forever, as commodities
too expensive to be indulged in, the men whom they loved; a fortune that would
buy him a peerage in England, obtain for him the
<i>justaucorps à brevet</i> in France, and orders and decorations, the command
of regiments, the governorships of provinces, embassies, stars and ribbons,
surround him with parasites and flatterers! Half a million pistoles! In English
money nigh upon five hundred thousand guineas!</p>

<p class="normal">As the berline rolled through St. Ouen and Aubervilliers, the
wheels sometimes sticking in a rut of the ill-kept roads--whereby the great,
cumbersome vehicle lurched so heavily that the young man expected to be
overturned at every moment--sometimes, too, scattering a flock of ducks and
fowls before it as they sought for subsistence amid the dust and filth, while
the coachman and postillion hurled curses at all and everything that came in
their way, and the English man servant in the banquette roared with laughter,
Martin Ashurst thought of what lay before him in the future. For he knew well
enough to what he went--the princess had long since apprised him of the
inheritance that was to be his--he knew that future. Yet he was not particularly
enamoured of it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The conditions,&quot; he muttered more than once to himself, &quot;are
irksome. To live in France, yet with my thoughts ever cast back to England, to
London, to St. James's and the suppers at Locket's and Pontac's, the merry
nights at Chaves's and White's. And--and--to be banished from England! Faugh!
whatever my aunt has to leave me can scarce be worth that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In sober truth, although he knew he was heir to Madame la
Princesse, he did not know how great the inheritance was to be. In thinking it
all over, in talking it all over, too, with his father and mother, he had
imagined with them that there might be some thirty or forty thousand pounds
which would be his, and that, owning this sum of money, he would thereby be a
rich man. But that any such sum as that which his aunt had really put aside was
ever likely to come to him had never entered his thoughts.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Also,&quot; he mused, &quot;how serve Louis, be subject to him when my
own country may require me? And though we are at peace, how long shall we be so?
Marlborough, the Dutch, are restless; they itch to fly at this French king's
throat. It will come again. It must. No treaty ever yet put an end to our wars
for any considerable time. Also--also--there is the other thing. In honour I
must tell her that, even though by doing so I cause her to renounce me, to
disinherit me. To leave me not so much as will pay the score at Locket's for
suppers. She must know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Down the Rue de la Boucherie the berline rumbled, the dry
fetid smell of the blood of slaughtered beasts being perceptible to the young
man's nostrils as he passed through it, since it was still the shambles of
Paris; down the Rue des Chants Poulets and past the Rue des Mauvais Garçons it
went, with still the driver hurling curses at all who got in his way, at
children playing in the road and at a
<i>cordelier</i> telling his beads as he walked, yet glinting an evil eye at the
coachman and muttering maledictions at him under his breath, and with the
English servant still laughing as now he donned his drugget coat and put on his
puff wig. For the driver, in between his curses and howls and whoops at the
animals, had found time to mutter that the next street was La Rue Champfleury,
though,  <i>diantre!</i> few flowers grew there now, except in the gardens of
the great Princesse de Rochebazon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sir,&quot; said the man servant, glancing down through the open
window in the back of the great vehicle, &quot;we are nearly there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know it,&quot; Martin Ashurst replied. Then asked suddenly, as
they passed under the  <i>Beau Dieu</i> stuck in a corner house of the street,
&quot;Why does he roar afresh, and why pull up with such a jerk?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There are red cords stretched all about the street, sir, in
front of a great house; also the road is half a foot deep in tan to deaden
sounds. And a fellow with a three-cornered hat as big as a table waves a gilt
stick to him to stop. What shall we do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, stop to be sure. Also I will alight. We have arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon he descended out of the berline, bidding the man
follow with his sword, as well as pay the driver and see to the necessaries
being taken off the roof. After which he passed through the cords, and
addressing the Suisse, said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How is it with Madame la Princesse?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame la Princesse still lives, monsieur,&quot; the man replied,
his eye roving over the scarlet coat and richly laced hat of the traveller;
noticing, too, the rings upon his fingers and the silver-hilted rapier carried
by the servant. &quot;Doubtless monsieur is the nephew of Madame la Princesse,
expected to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am he.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With a bow the man invited Martin Ashurst to follow him, and
led him through a cool vestibule to where some footmen stood about, then ordered
them to conduct monsieur to his apartment, saying that possibly he would desire
to make his toilet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The rooms prepared for monsieur are those he has occupied
often before, I hear,&quot; this man of importance said. &quot;Upon this  <i>étage</i>,
giving on the garden, if monsieur pleases.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And now, left alone with only his servant to attend upon him,
monsieur made a hasty toilet, washing from off his hands and face the dust and
dirt of the journey, discarding, too, his scarlet coat and waistcoat for others
of a more suitable colour, changing his wig and shoes and stockings. Then bade
the man go say that if the princess would receive him he was ready to attend
upon her.</p>

<p class="normal">Sitting there waiting to be summoned to her presence, his eyes
glancing out through the long open windows on to the fresh, green garden with
its banks of roses, now drooping with the advent of autumn, he thought of all
that she had done for him since first he could remember. Of how, as a child,
when he lived in this great house, or went with her in the summer heats to fair
Touraine--where was a castle of the de Rochebazon's embowered in woods--or to
that other great château in Perche, or to still a third one which hung over the
golden sands of La Gironde, she seemed to live almost to shower gentle
kindnesses upon him, her brother's child. To do all for him that she would have
done had he been her own; to surround him with luxuries far too good and dainty
for one so young as he; to provide him with tutors and keepers, with horses and
carriages and rich silks and satins, and gold pieces in his pockets to fling to
beggars as other men flung sols and deniers, because she loved him, and in her
love had but one regret--that he was not a de Rochebazon to succeed to all they
owned.</p>

<p class="normal">Also, when they were separated, he in England, she at
Versailles, how much she had done for him as he grew to manhood! How much! How
much! Money sent over for his pleasures because she desired that, in all things,
he should have the best, should be able to hold his own with those who were in
the court circle and the fashion. That his early years should never know any
narrowness of means which in after life might cramp him as he recalled it; also
that, as he stepped over the threshold of youth and reached manhood, he should
do so with ease and comfort.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I owe her all, everything,&quot; he mused to himself as still his
eyes gazed out upon the trim-kept and still luxurious  <i>parterres</i> of the
great gardens. &quot;All, all! My father, beggared as he was by his loyalty, could
have done naught beyond equipping me for some simple, unambitious calling,
beyond, perhaps, obtaining me a pair of colours in some marching regiment. I owe
her all--the clothes upon my back, the food I eat, the very knowledge of how to
wield a sword! And--and--God forgive me! I have deceived her for years, kept
back for years a secret that should not have existed for one hour. Still, she
shall know now. She shall not go to her grave without knowing that I have no
right to own one single livre that she has put aside for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he finished his reflections the door was rapped at, and the
footman, entering at his command, told him that the Demoiselle Manon was without
and waiting to escort him to the bedside of Madame la Princesse.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_03" href="#div1Ref_03">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<h5>A PARTING SOUL.</h5>

<p class="normal">Looking down upon her as she lay in the great bed whereon had
reposed so many of the de Rochebazons for generations--when they had been the
head of the house--Martin Ashurst told himself how, except for the reason that
he was about to lose the kindest benefactress and kinswoman any man had ever
had, there was no cause for the tears to rise to his eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">For never was a more peaceful parting about to be made, to all
external appearances; never could a woman have trod more calmly the dark road
that, sooner or later, all have to pass along, than was now treading Aurora,
Princesse de Rochebazon. Also it seemed as if death was smoothing away every
wrinkle that time had brought to her face, changing back that face to the soft,
innocent one which, in the spring of life, had been Aurora Ashurst's greatest
charm; the face that had been hers when, as a winsome child, she played in the
meadows round her father's old home in Worcestershire--demolished by Lambert;
the face that, but a few years later, had won Henri de Beauvilliers away from
the intoxicating charms of Mancinis, of Clerembaults, of Baufremonts, and
Châtillons, and a hundred other beauties who then revolved round the court of
the young king, now grown so old.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do not suffer, dear and honoured one,&quot; Martin said,
bending over her and gazing into the eyes that were still so bright--the last
awful glazed look and vacant stare, which tell of the near end being still some
hours off; &quot;you do not suffer, dear one. That I can see, and thank God for so
seeing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; the princess said, &quot;I have no pain. I am dying simply of
what comes to all--decay. I am seventy years of age, and it has come to me a
little earlier than it does sometimes. That is all. But, Martin, we have no time
to talk of this. Time is short--I know that.&quot; Then, suddenly lifting the clear
eyes to his own, she said, &quot;Do you know why I sent a special courier to London
for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To bid me hurry to you, I should suppose, dear one. To give
me your blessing. Oh!&quot; he exclaimed, bending a little nearer to her, &quot;you are a
saint. You would not part from me without giving me that. Therefore bless me
now!&quot; and he made as though he would kneel by her side betwixt the bed and the  <i>
ruelle</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Wait,&quot; she said, &quot;wait. I have something to tell you. After I
have done so I know not if you will still deem me a saint, still desire my
blessing. Bring that chair within the  <i>ruelle</i>; sit down and listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Because he thought that already her mind was beginning to
enter that hazy approach to death in which the senses lose all clearness, and
the dying, when they speak at all, speak wanderingly, he neither showed nor felt
wonderment at her words. Instead, because he desired to soothe and calm her, he
did as she bade him, drawing the chair within the rail and holding her hand as
he did so.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whatever,&quot; he said softly, &quot;you may tell me can make no
difference in my love and reverence for you--make me desire your blessing less
or deem you less a saint. Yet--yet--if it pleases you to speak, if you have
aught you desire to say, say on. Still, I beseech you, weary not yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At first she did not answer him, but lay quite still, her eyes
fixed on his face; lay so still that from far down the room he heard the ticking
of the clock, heard the logs fall softly together with a gentle clash now and
again, even found himself listening to a bird twittering outside in the garden.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, suddenly, once more her voice sounded clearly in the
silence of the room; he heard her say: &quot;What I tell you now will make me
accursed in the eyes of all the Church--our Church. I am about to confide to you
a secret that all in that Church have ordered me never to divulge, or I would
have done it long since. Yet now I must tell it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A secret,&quot; he repeated silently to himself, &quot;a secret!&quot;
Therefore he knew that her mind must indeed be wandering. What secret could this
saintly woman have to reveal? Ah! yes, she was indeed wandering! Yet, even as he
thought this, he reflected how strange a thing it was that, while he had
actually a revelation to make to her--one that his honour prompted him to
make--she, in the delirium of coming death, should imagine that she had
something which it behooved her to disclose.</p>

<p class="normal">Once more he heard her speaking. Heard her say:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All deem that with me perishes the last bearer, man or woman,
of the de Rochebazon name. It is not so. There is probably one in existence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame!&quot; the young man exclaimed very quietly, yet startled,
almost appalled. &quot;Madame! A de Rochebazon in existence! Are you conscious of
what you are saying?&quot; and he leaned a little over the coverlet and gazed into
her eyes as he spoke. Surely  <i>this</i> was wandering.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As conscious as that I am dying here, as that you, Martin
Ashurst, are sitting by my side.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am astounded. How long has what you state been
known--supposed--by you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Known--not supposed--since I became Henri de Beauvillier's
wife, forty-six years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God! What does it mean? A de Rochebazon alive! Man or
woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Man!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again Martin exclaimed, &quot;My God!&quot; Then added: &quot;And this man,
therefore, is, has been since the death of your husband, the Prince de
Rochebazon?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Before my husband's death,&quot; the other answered quietly,
calmly, as though speaking on the most trivial subject. &quot;My husband never was
the prince.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Unintentionally, without doubt--perhaps, too, unnoticed by
her--his hand released hers, slipping down from the bedside to his knee, where
it lay, while he, his eyes fixed full on her now and still seeking to read in
her face whether that which she uttered was the frenzy of a dying woman or an
absolute truth, said slowly and distinctly:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nor you, therefore--that I must utter the words!--the
princess?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nor I the princess.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is incredible. Beyond all belief.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is true.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again there was a pause; filled up on Martin Ashurst's part
with a hurtling mass of thoughts which he could not separate one from the other,
though above all others there predominated one--the thought that this was the
derangement of a mind unhinged by the weakness of approaching death, clouded by
the gradual decay of nature. And, thinking thus, he sat silent, wondering if in
very truth--since all she had said seemed so utterly beyond the bound of
possibility--it were worth disturbing her with questions.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet her next words seemed uttered as though with a
determination to force him to believe that what she had said was no delusion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There are others who know it--only they will never tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Others! Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame knows it&quot;--he was well enough aware  <i>what</i>
&quot;Madame&quot; she referred to, and that it was to neither her of Orleans nor any of
the daughters of the house of France--&quot;so, too, does La Chaise, and also
Chamillart. Also,&quot; and now her voice sank to a whisper, &quot;Louis.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Louis!&quot; he repeated, also whisperingly, yet not recognising
that his voice was lowered instinctively. &quot;The king! knows and permits. My God!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He must permit, seeing that she--De Maintenon--holds him in a
grasp of steel.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Knowing--herself?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have said.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again over the room there fell a silence, broken only by the
ticking of the distant clock; also now the shadows of evening were drawing on,
soon the night would be at hand--a silence caused by the dying woman having
ceased to speak, by the man at her side forbearing to ask more questions.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet he was warned by signs which even he, who had as yet but
little acquaintance with death, could not misinterpret; that what more was to be
told must be declared at once, or--never. For the dying woman made no further
effort to divulge more, or to explain aught which should elucidate the strange
statement she had startled him with; instead, lay back upon her pillows, her
eyes open, it was true, but staring vacantly upon the embossed and
richly-painted ceiling, her breathing still regular but very low.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She will speak no more,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;no more. Thank
God, the secret does not die with her. Yet will those whom she has
mentioned--this woman who is the king's wife; the king himself; La Chaise, who,
if all accounts are true, is a lying, crafty priest; the minister
Chamillart--will they assist to right a wrong? Alas, I fear not! Ah, if she
could but speak again--tell all!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As thus he thought, the door opened and the waiting maid came
in, accompanied by a gentleman clad in sombre black, his lace being, however, of
the whitest and most costly nature, and his face as white as that lace itself.
And the girl, advancing down the room, followed by the other, explained to
Martin, when she had reached the bed, that the gentleman accompanying her was
Monsieur Fagon,  <i>premier Médecin du Roi</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">Bowing to him with much courtliness, the physician passed
within the
<i>ruelle</i> and stood gazing down upon the dying woman in what was now no
better than twilight, but going through, as the other observed, none of the
usual ceremonies of feeling the pulse or listening to the breathing. Then once
he nodded his head, after which he turned away, stepping outside the  <i>ruelle</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What may we hope, monsieur?&quot; the young man asked, following
Fagon down the room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What,&quot; answered Fagon in return, &quot;does monsieur hope?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That she may be spared for yet some hours--more, I fear, can
scarcely be expected. Also that she may be able to speak again and clearly. I am
her nephew, and, in a manner of speaking, am--was to be--her heir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">From under his bushy eyebrows Fagon shot a glance out of his
small twinkling eyes. Then he said: &quot;So I have heard. Yet monsieur, if he will
pardon me, phrases his statement strangely, in spite of his having the French
extremely well. 'Was to be her heir!' Has monsieur reason to apprehend that
Madame la Princesse has made any alteration in her testamentary dispositions?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur has no reason to apprehend that such is the case.
Yet,&quot; changing the subject, &quot;he would be very glad if he could know that some
hours of life will still be granted to--to--Madame la Princesse; that he might
hope she will be able to converse again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sir,&quot; Fagon said, with still the little twinkling eyes upon
him, &quot;she may live two or three more hours. I doubt her ever speaking again.
There is no more to be done. Sir, I salute you.&quot; With which words he departed,
escorted by the maid servant Manon.</p>

<p class="normal">It seemed, however, to Martin as though even should his aunt
recover consciousness and be able to throw any further light upon the strange
story which she had commenced, no opportunity would arise for her to do so, for
Fagon had not been gone a quarter of an hour, during which time she lay so
motionless in her bed that more than once he gazed down upon her, wondering if
already the soul had parted from the body, before the monk who had previously
been in attendance came in, and going toward the great fireplace drew forth his
missal and began to read it. Nor was it without some difficulty that Martin was
able to induce him to quit the room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Depart!&quot; this holy man said, glancing up at the tall form of
the other as he whispered his request to him. &quot;Depart, my son! Alas! do you not
know that the end is near--that at any moment the last services of the Church
may be required to speed the passing soul?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know, nor do I intend that she shall be deprived of those
services. But, reverend sir, it is necessary I should be alone with my
kinswoman; if she recovers her intelligence even at the last moment we have much
to say to one another. I beg you, therefore, to leave us together; be sure you
shall not be debarred from ministering to her when she desires you. I request
you to remain outside--yet within call.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Because he knew not how to resist, because also he was but a
humble member of the Théatine confraternity who, in Paris at least, owed much to
the wealth and support of the Rochebazons, also because in his ignorance he
thought he stood in the presence of him who was, he imagined in his simplicity,
the next possessor of that great name and the vast revenues attached to it, he
went as bidden, begging only that he might be summoned at the necessary moment.</p>

<p class="normal">Then for a little while kinsman and kinswoman were alone once
more.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will she ever speak again, tell me further?&quot; Martin mused
again, gazing down on the silent woman lying there, her features now lit up a
little by the rays of a shaded  <i>veilleuse</i> that had been brought into the
chamber by Manon and placed near the great bed. &quot;I pray God she may.&quot; Then
murmured to himself: &quot;As well as I can see--'tis but darkly, Heaven knows--yet
so far as I can peer into the future, on me there falls the task of righting a
great wrong, done, if not by her, at least by those to whose house she belongs.
But, to do so much, I must have light.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It seemed to him, watching there, as though the light was
coming--was at hand. For now the occupant of the bed by which he sat stirred;
her eyes, he saw, were fixed on him; a moment later she spoke. But the voice was
changed, he recognised--was hoarse and harsh, hollow and toneless.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Henri,&quot; she murmured, with many pauses 'twixt her words,
&quot;Henri was not the eldest. There was--another--son--a--a--Protestant--a
Huguenot----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Great God! what sin is here?&quot; the startled watcher muttered;
then spoke more loudly: &quot;Yes, yes, oh, speak, speak! Continue, I beseech you.
Another son--a Huguenot--and the eldest!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That a de Rochebazon should be--a--Huguenot,&quot; the now dry
voice muttered raucously, &quot;a Huguenot! And fierce--relentless--strong, even to
renouncing all--all--his rank, his name, his birthri----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again she ceased; he thought the end had come. Surely the once
clear eyes were glazing now, surely this dull glare at vacancy which expressed
indefinitely that, glare how they might, they saw nothing, foretold death--near,
close at hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Some word, some name, madame, dear one,&quot; the listener
whispered. &quot;Speak, oh! speak, or else all effort must fail. His name--that which
his brother called him--that which he took, if he renounced his rightful one.
The name--or--God help us all! naught can be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His name,&quot; the dying woman whispered through white lips, in
accents too low to reach the listener's ears, &quot;was----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">If she uttered it he did not hear it. Moreover, at this
supreme moment there came another interruption--the last!</p>

<p class="normal">The door opened again. Down the room, advancing toward the
bed, came a priest, a man thin to attenuation, dry and brown as a mummy, with
eyes that burned like coals beneath an eyebrowless forehead, yet one who told
his beads even as he advanced, his lips quivering and moving while he prayed.</p>

<p class="normal">Do the dying know, even as we bend over them, seeking to
penetrate beneath that glassy stare which suggests so deep an oblivion, of the
last word we would have them speak, the last question we would have answered ere
the veil of dense impenetrable darkness falls forever between them and us?</p>

<p class="normal">Almost it seemed as if she, this sinking woman who had lived
for years a great princess, yet, by her own avowal, was none, did in truth know
what her kinsman sought to drag from her--the clew which should lead to the
righting of a great wrong, as he had said.</p>

<p class="normal">For, as the priest came through the lurking shadows of the
room and out of the darkness of the farther end, toward where the small night
lamp cast its sickly shadow, the hand which Martin Ashurst held closed tighter
upon his own, and with a quivering grasp drew his toward her body, placing it
upon a small substance that had lain sheltering 'twixt her arm and side.</p>

<p class="normal">And even as thus his hand closed over hers, while that other
quivered warm and damp within it, the priest knelt and, over his crucifix,
uttered up prayers for the passing soul.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_04" href="#div1Ref_04">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h5>LES ATTROUPÉS.</h5>

<p class="normal">It was October in the year 1701 when she who had borne the
title for so long of Princesse de Rochebazon was laid in the family vault in the
Church of St. Sépulcre. It was July of the next year when a gentleman, looking
somewhat travel-stained and weary, halted his horse at the foot of the Mont de
Lozère, in Languedoc--the same man who had travelled from England eight months
ago as Martin Ashurst, to attend his aunt's death-bed, but who since then had
been known as Monsieur Martin.</p>

<p class="normal">There were more reasons than one why this change of name
should be made--primarily because war having been declared by England in
conjunction with Austria and Holland against Louis, no subject of Queen Anne was
permitted within France, or, being in, would be safe if known and identified as
such. But with an assumed name, or rather with part of his own name
discarded--Martin being common to both countries--and with his knowledge of the
French language perfect, owing to his long residence in the country as a child,
the identification of Martin Ashurst with England was, if he held his peace,
almost impossible. Also there were other reasons. He believed that at last he
had found traces of the missing man, of him to whom by right fell all the vast
wealth of the de Rochebazons, accumulated for centuries.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet even now,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;God knows if I shall
succeed in finding him, or even should I do so, if I shall persuade him to claim
what is his own. And, though he should still be willing, will that scourge of
God, Louis, that curse of France, his wife, let one penny ever come to his
hands? A Huguenot, and with the Huguenots in open rebellion, what chance would
he have? I must be careful, more careful than ever, now that I am in the hotbed
of revolution.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he pondered thus he turned his wrist and urged his horse
forward at a walk, making his way on slowly through the mountains to the village
of Montvert.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Three months,&quot; he said, &quot;three months since I set out for
Switzerland--for Geneva and Lausanne--and now, even now, but little nearer to
the end than before. Coming here, I was told that it was almost impossible that
Cyprien de Beauvilliers could have settled in the Cévennes without being known;
travelling on to Savoy and to Lausanne, I learn at last that he did most
undoubtedly come here from Geneva years ago. Shall I ever know--ever find out?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A league or so accomplished at a walking pace, for his poor
beast was almost exhausted now, it having been ridden across the mountains from
St. Victor de Gravière since daybreak, and from Geneva within the last three
weeks, and the banks of a river named Le Tarn being slowly followed, the rider
entered Montvert, and passing across the bridge, proceeded slowly up the village
street. Yet even as he did so he cast his eyes on a house at the side of that
bridge and on the small trim garden between it and the stream, muttering to
himself:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah! Monsieur l'abbé! Monsieur l'abbé! you are one of the
firebrands who stir up dissension in these valleys--you and your familiar
spirit, Baville. Also your evil fame has travelled far. You are known and hated
in Geneva, Lausanne, Vevey--maybe in Holland by now. 'Tis best you pray to
Heaven to avert your fate. 'Tis threatened! And, if all the stories of you be
true, it is almost deserved, no matter in what form it comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Proceeding still farther along the little main street of the
bourg, he came to a wooden house also standing in a small trimly-kept garden, in
which there grew all kinds of simple flowers that made the place gay with their
colours, and here he dismounted, while calling to a boy who was raking the
crushed shells on the path, he bade him take his horse to the stable in the
rear.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For you see, Armand,&quot; he said with a pleasant smile, &quot;here I
am back again, after a long while--yet still back.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The boy smiled a greeting and said all would be glad to
welcome him, then did as he was bid and led the animal away, while Martin, going
up to the door, knocked lightly on it and asked, as he threw his voice into the
passage, if the  <i>pasteur</i> was within.</p>

<p class="normal">To which, in answer, there came down toward the door an
elderly gray-haired man, who held out both his hands and shook those of the
younger one cordially.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Back! Back!&quot; he exclaimed joyously. &quot;Ah! this is good. Come
in. Come in. The room is always ready, the bed kept aired, the lavender in the
drawers. Welcome! Welcome!&quot; Then, after looking at him and saying that his
journey had not harmed him, he exclaimed: &quot;Well, what news? Or--is it
disappointment again?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But little news; scarcely, in truth, more than before. Yet
something. I met a man at Geneva who had known Cyprien de Beauvilliers, but he
was very old and, alas! it is forty years and more since he set eyes on him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Forty years! A lifetime!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, a lifetime--long enough for him to have disappeared from
all human knowledge, to have died. That, I fear, is what has happened.
Otherwise, this man says, they of the reformed faith would almost surely have
heard of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not of necessity,&quot; the pastor answered. &quot;If he so hated his
kin and their religion that he was determined to break off forever from them and
their customs, he may have resolved to obliterate every clew. He told the
princess's husband that he renounced his name, his birthright. Other men have
resolved on that, and kept their resolution.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">While they had been speaking the pastor had led Martin Ashurst
into his little salon, and he called now to an elderly woman to prepare the
evening meal.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And a good one to-night, Margot; a good one to-night to
welcome back the wanderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon the old servant smiled upon that wanderer and murmured
also some words of greeting, while she said it should be a good one.
<i>Fichtre</i>, but it should!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Soit!</i> Let us see,&quot; went on her master. &quot;First for the
solids. Now, there is a trout, caught this morning and brought me by Leroux--oh,
such a trout! Two kilos if an ounce, and with the true deep speckles.
<i>Ma foi!</i> he was a fool, he clung too much to the neighbourhood of the
lower bridge, derided Leroux with his wicked eye; yet, observe, Leroux has got
him.  <i>Si! Si!</i> Half an hour hence he will be  <i>truite au vin blanc</i>,
a thing not half so wholesome for him as the stream and the rushes.  <i>Hein!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Martin smiled to himself, yet gravely, as always now since his
aunt's dying revelation. How far off seemed to him the merry days, or nights, at
Locket's and Pontac's, and the jokes and jeers and flashes of wit of Betterton
and Nokes, Vanburgh and gentle Farquhar!--while still the good old pastor
prattled on, happy at preparing his little feast.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Truite au vin blanc</i>. Ha! And the right wine, too, to
wash it down. Ha! The  <i>Crépi</i>, in the long, tapering glasses that the
Chevalier de Fleuville brought me from Villefranche. Poor de Fleuville! Poor,
poor de Fleuville! Then, Margot, the  <i>ragoût</i> and the white chipped bread,
and, forget not these, clean  <i>serviettes</i> to-night, if we never have
others, and the cheese from Joyeuse. Oh! we will  <i>faire la noce</i>
to-night,  <i>mon brave</i>. God forgive me,&quot; he broke off suddenly, his voice
changing, &quot;that even your return should make me think of feasts and  <i>noces</i>
at such a time as this--a time of blood and horror and cruelty!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Over the meal, the trout being all that was expected of him,
and the
<i>Crépi</i> a fitting accompaniment thereto, they talked on what had been the
object of &quot;Monsieur Martin's&quot; journey into Switzerland, then neutral in both
religion and politics, and offering, consequently, a home for refugees of all
classes and denominations; talked also of what results that journey had had, or
had failed to have. But all ended, or was comprised, in what the young man had
already told the other--namely, that it seemed certain that Cyprien de
Beauvilliers had at first gone to Geneva and Lausanne after he renounced his
family and his religion, and that from there he had come to Languedoc, meaning
to settle in the one spot in France where Protestantism was in its strongest
force.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He would thereby,&quot; the pastor said, as now they reached the  <i>
fromage de Joyeuse</i>, nestling white and creamy in the vine leaves, &quot;be able
to enjoy his religion in peace for many years, until--until the unhappy events
of '85. Alas! that revocation! That revocation, born of that fearful woman!
What--what will be the outcome of all, for even now it is but beginning to bear
its worst fruits. Martin,&quot; he continued, &quot;Martin,  <i>mon ami</i>, we are but at
the commencement. I fear for what will happen here ere long. I fear, I fear, I
fear.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here! Is it as bad as that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is dreadful, appalling. My friend, they will suffer no
longer. They can support neither Baville's tyranny, which extends over all the
district, nor--here, in this little village once so happy--the monstrous
cruelties of the abbé.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The abbé! Du Chaila! What is he doing now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tongue scarce dare tell for fear of not being believed. In
after years, in centuries to come, when religion is free and tolerant, as some
day it must be--it must! it must!--those who read of what we have suffered will
deem the story false. O Martin! there, in that house by the bridge, are done
things that would almost excite the envy of the Inquisition, ay! of Torquemada
himself, were he still in existence. And he, this abbé, is the man who will
light the flame in this tranquil spot. I pray God it may be extinguished almost
ere lit.&quot; And Martin Ashurst saw that even as he spoke his hands were folded
under the table, as though in prayer, and that his lips moved.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But what,&quot; he said, &quot;what do you fear? Also to what extremes
does he now proceed?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Proceed!' Ah, Martin, listen. There in that house by the
bridge, once Fleuville's, who was hung by De Genne upon the bridge itself, so
that his wife might see the thing each morning when she rose, he tortures us,
the Protestants. Keeps prisoners confined, too, in the cellars deeper than the
river itself. In stocks some, naked some, some with food only twice a week. He
boasts he is God's appointed, then jeers and says, 'Appointed, too, by Baville
under Louis.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And Louis knows this?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Some say not, some say yes. For myself, I do not know. But
things are near the end.&quot; And again the good pastor murmured, &quot;I fear, I fear, I
fear.&quot; Then went on, his voice lowered now and his eyes glancing through the
windows, opened to let in the soft autumn air, cool and luscious as though it
had passed over countless groves of flowers: &quot;Listen. Masip--you have heard of
him, Masip, the guide, he who shows the way to Switzerland and freedom--he is
now there, in the cellars, in the stocks, bent double, his hands through two
holes above the two where his feet are.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He showed the Demoiselles Sexti the road to Chambery--they
went dressed as boys. The girls escaped into the mountains. Masip is doomed. He
dies to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God help him!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Him! God help all, Martin. He hunts us everywhere. Some of my
brother preachers have been executed; I myself am suspended, my hour may
come--to-night--to-morrow. Sooner or later it must come. Then for me the wheel
or the flames or the gibbet--there.&quot; And he pointed down the street toward where
the bridge was on which Fleuville's body had been hanged.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never! Never!&quot; Martin exclaimed, touching the old man's arm.
&quot;Never, while I have a sword by my side.&quot; Then added, a moment later:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My friend, I must declare myself. While all are so brave, all
going to, or risking, their doom, I am but a craven hound to wear a mask.
To-morrow I announce--or rather denounce--myself as a Protestant. My aunt died
ere I could tell the secret which would have caused her to curse me instead of
leaving me her heir. Here, I will shelter myself under that secret no more.
To-morrow I see this abbé in his own house, to-morrow I defy him to do his worst
on me as on others. I proclaim myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no, no!&quot; the old pastor cried, springing at him, placing
his hand upon his lips to prevent further words from being heard or from
penetrating outside. &quot;No, no! In God's name, no! I forbid you. If you do that,
how will you ever find de Beauvilliers--de Rochebazon, as he is if alive--or, he
being dead, find his children? I forbid you,&quot; he reiterated again and again in
his agitation. &quot;I forbid you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Forbid me? Force me to live a coward in my own esteem? To see
those of my own faith slaughtered like oxen in the shambles and stand by, a
poltroon, afraid to declare myself?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I forbid you. Not yet, at least. Remember, too, you are an
Englishman, of France's deepest, most hated foes; your doom is doubly
threatening. Yet, oh, oh, my son,&quot; he exclaimed in a broken voice, &quot;how I love,
how I reverence you! Brave man, brave, honest Protestant, I love--my God!&quot; he
exclaimed, changing his tone suddenly, desisting in his speech, &quot;My God! what is
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Desisted, turning a stricken, blanched face upon the younger
man, who had reached for his sword and sash and was already donning them, while
he whispered through white lips, &quot;It has come! It has come! The storm has
burst,&quot; while even as he spoke he fell on his knees by the table, and sinking
his head into his hands, commenced to pray long and silently.</p>

<p class="normal">Prayed long and silently, while from outside the bourg--yet
advancing, approaching nearer every moment--there came a deep sound. At first a
hum, then, next, a clearer, more definite noise, and next, they being
distinguishable, the words of a hymn sung by many voices.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon the soft night air, so calm and peaceful a moment
earlier, those words rolled, the cadence falling and rising until it seemed as
though it must reach the mountain tops o'erhanging the village. Rolled up and
swelled, and sunk and rose again, telling how the Lord set ambushments against
the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who came against Judah; telling
how, when they had made an end of one of their particular foes, each helped to
destroy another.</p>

<p class="normal">Again the pastor moaned: &quot;They have risen. They have risen.
God help us all!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who?&quot; asked Martin. &quot;Who? Our own faith? The Protestants? The
Camisards? Risen at last.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At last! At last!&quot; the old man said, glancing up from his
prayers. And he began to pray aloud to God to avert the horrors of battle and
murder and sudden death.</p>

<p class="normal">The tramp of many men came nearer. Past the foot of the garden
those men went, a compact mass; in their hands and belts, and borne also upon
their shoulders, swords, old halberds, musketoons and pistols, in some cases
scythes and reaping hooks. And ahead of all marched three gaunt, weird men, the
inspired ones, the prophets of the Cevennes, of the Camisards.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Keep all within doors,&quot; a deep-toned voice exclaimed from out
the throng, &quot;on pain of death. Disturb not the children of God, his persecuted
ones. No harm is meant to those who interfere not. Keep within doors, also
appear not at the windows. All will thereby be well.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And again the psalm uprose, though now there were some who
shouted: &quot;To the vile abbé's! To the murderer's! To the house on the bridge! On!
On! The soldiers first, the abbé next! On! On! To avenge the Lord!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then from farther ahead there rang the report of musketry, and
one man fell dead pell-mell among the moving crowd, and was left lying in the
white dust of the roadway, as from the window Martin could well see. But still
the others shouted: &quot;On! On! God's will be done!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And again the pastor lifted his hands from where he knelt and
cried aloud, &quot;From battle, murder, and sudden death, good Lord deliver us.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_05" href="#div1Ref_05">CHAPTER V.</a></h4>

<h5>'TWIXT THEN AND NOW.</h5>

<p class="normal">When Martin Ashurst bent over her who had borne for over forty
years the title of Princesse de Rochebazon, and saw that, at last, the light had
gone out of her eyes forever, he recognised how her dying words had changed his
whole existence. Not only was he no more the heir to the wealth she had put by
for him--his honour never halted for one moment in telling him that, or in
dictating the renouncement of every sol that was hers--but also there had arisen
before him a task which, his honour again speaking clear and trumpet-tongued, he
must devote his life to fulfilling. He had to find the true Prince de
Rochebazon, or, which was more likely, if he ever succeeded in his search at
all, to find that man's children and put before them a plain account of all the
wealth which was theirs, even though they should not be induced to accept it.</p>

<p class="normal">That if he could discover the missing de Rochebazon, even
though he were still alive, he would find him willing to reclaim what was his,
he doubted. A man who could for more than forty years renounce one of the most
brilliant positions in France because of his religious convictions was not very
likely now to alter those convictions, he knew. Also Martin Ashurst's
acquaintance with the land over which the Grand Monarque reigned was amply
sufficient to tell him that here, and under the all-powerful domination of the
self-righteous De Maintenon, Louis would never allow a hated Protestant to step
into the wealth and titles of so Romish a family as that of the de Rochebazons.
Between these two stumbling blocks, therefore--the Protestantism of the lost man
on one side, and the bigotry of the arbiter of France on the other--it was
scarcely to be hoped that even though he should find him whom he sought, he
should succeed in his endeavour to restore to that man what was his.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, because he was honest and straightforward, he swore to at
least make the attempt.</p>

<p class="normal">Regaining his own room, in which the lights had been
placed--even with the mistress and last ruler of the great house lying dead in
it, the major domo had deemed it fit that waxen candles should blaze from
girandoles in every passage and room of the hotel, and that naught should be
omitted which testified to its sumptuousness and magnificence--he recollected
that he was still grasping in his hand the packet which the dying woman had
directed that hand to, for he had forgotten almost that he had received it from
her, so agitated was he during her last moments; now that it recalled its
presence to him, he determined that he would as soon as might be discover what
it contained.</p>

<p class="normal">But first he knew that there were other things to be done:
Orders to be given that due proclamation of her death should be made; that,
above all, the heads of her Church should at once be communicated with, since
the monk now praying by her side would not, he was aware, quit the house, even
though he had to leave the body while it was prepared for the grave; that a
courier should be sent to Marly, where the king was; that the seals should be
put on everything.</p>

<p class="normal">There was much to do still ere he could open that packet which
might tell him all--or nothing.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet by midnight, before the great bell struck the hour from
St. Eustache, as much was done as possible. Aurora, Princesse de Rochebazon,
lay, not in her coffin; that, with its emblazonments and silver feet and
coronets at its corners, as well as the great silver plaque telling of all the
rank and honours and titles she had borne--unrighteously, if her own dying words
were true--could not be prepared hurriedly. Instead, upon her bed, now
transformed into a temporary bier, as the great room in which she had died had
been transformed into a  <i>Chapelle Ardente</i>. Also the courier was gone, the
Church apprised of the death of its open-handed benefactress; already the Abbé
Le Tellier (confessor to the king and all the royal family, and titulary bishop
and coadjutor of Reims) was here, he having arrived from St. Cloud as fast as
his  <i>chaise roulante</i> could bring him; also the place swarmed with
priests--Theatines, Dominicans, Benedictines, and Augustines; the seals, too,
were on doors and coffers and bureaux.</p>

<p class="normal">Likewise, Samuel Bernard,  <i>traitant</i> and banker to the  <i>
haut monde</i>, had paid a visit and been closeted for an hour with the clergy.
For the Church was the principal inheritor of the de Rochebazon wealth, and the
time had come for it to grasp its heritage.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet now, at midnight, the great house was at last quiet; the
monks prayed in silence in the room where the dead woman lay; the Suisse sat
behind the high closed gates refreshing himself with the flask of yellow
muscadine which the butler had brought him, and discussing with that functionary
what  <i>legs</i> each were like to get; some women servants who had loved their
dead mistress wept in their beds.</p>

<p class="normal">All was still at last.</p>

<p class="normal">Martin opened the packet in that silence--he had dismissed his
own servant an hour before--and inspected its contents.</p>

<p class="normal">They were not numerous--half a dozen letters and a lock of
hair, golden, fair as the ripening cornfield, long, and with a curl to it. But,
except that and the letters, nothing else. Whose hair it was that had thus been
preserved in a piece of satin Martin never knew, yet perhaps could guess.</p>

<p class="normal">The letters lay one above the other in the order they had been
written. The first and uppermost had the upper portion of it torn away, possibly
by accident, or perhaps, instead, by the recipient who, it may be, was not
desirous that the place whence it was dated should be known. At least such,
Martin Ashurst fancied, might be the case. The paper it was written on was
yellow with age, the ink faded, yet the words still clear and distinct, the
writing firm. Because the top of the sheet was torn away some of the first lines
of the communication were themselves missing, therefore the letter ran thus:</p>
<br>

<p class="continue">&quot;... her fault upon me.  <i>Soit!</i> I bow to what you say.
Yet, if disinheritance of all that should be mine is your determination, my
place in the world you can never disinherit me from; I myself alone can renounce
that. The pity is great that you have it not also in your power to deprive me of
the qualities of mind and heart which you have transmitted to me. Yet I pray God
that I may find in myself the strength to do so, to cast away from me the pride
of race, the fierce cruelty of heart, the intolerance of all that is not within
my own circle of vision. Also your power of hating another for the fault
committed, not by himself, but an unhappy mother--a mother driven to sin by
coldness from him who should have reverenced her; the victim of a gloomy, morose
nature, of a self-esteem that would be absurd even in the king himself, of a
pride that might rival the pride of Lucifer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To reproach you, however, for sins which I may myself have
inherited from you--since even you do not deny me as your son--would be useless.
Therefore it is better for me to write at once that I do not oppose the
disinheritance with which you threaten me. Nay, rather, I go hand in hand with
you, only, also, I go to a greater extent. You tell me that if I embrace the
Reformed Faith no sol or denier of the de Rochebazon wealth shall ever be mine,
that I shall enjoy a barren title. This you can not force me to do. I will
support no title whatever. Henceforth, neither de Rochebazon, nor d'Ançilly, nor
Montrachet, nor Beauvilliers have aught to do with me. I cast them off. I forget
that the house which bears those titles is one with which I have any connection.
I go forth into the world alone, under a lowly name. The roof that covers me,
the food for my mouth, the clothes to cover my nakedness, will be earned by my
own hands. Moreover, so do I steel my heart that henceforth even my brother,
Henri, will be lost to me forever. He becomes, therefore, your heir; may he find
in you a better father than I have ever done. Consequently, for the last time on
this earth, I sign myself,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50%">
&quot;<span class="sc">Cyprien de Beauvillers</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Martin laid the paper down on the table before him and sat
back musing in his chair. &quot;A stern, fierce determination that,&quot; he muttered to
himself, &quot;arrived at by a man who would keep his word. Let us see for the next.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he read this next one it was easy to perceive what course
the rupture between the father and son had taken; how the iron will of the one
had beaten down that of the other. Already the elder had sued for
reconciliation--and had failed.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;What you now desire,&quot; the man wrote, who had once been
Cyprien de Beauvilliers, &quot;is impossible. First, on the ground of religion, and
secondly, because of yourself. I am now of the Protestant faith, have embraced
that faith in Holland, to which country you appear to have tracked my steps, I
know not how. Yet that you shall never be able to do so in the future, I leave
it at once, and from the time when I quit it I defy you to ever discover my
whereabouts. Let me remind you that this change of faith alone is a bar to my
ever reassuming my position as your successor; if it were not such bar I would
proceed to even other extremes to deprive myself of the succession; would draw
my sword against France if by doing so I could more utterly sever myself from
you and all connected with you.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You ask me if I hate you? I reply that I hate the man who
drove my mother to evil by his intolerant and contemptible pride, and, fallen as
she became, I love and adore her memory. But my heart is not large enough to
find space in it for aught else. Not large enough----&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">There was no more. The sheet of paper turned over at the word
&quot;enough,&quot; and no other succeeded to it.</p>

<p class="normal">Again Martin lay back musing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was firm,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Firm. The years which have rolled
by and become forgotten since he wrote these lines, now so faded, prove that;
otherwise  <i>she</i> would have known of his existence, his whereabouts.
And--and--she was a just woman in spite of the deception of her life. If she had
known that he was still alive she would never have consented to usurp all his
rights. Nay, not though every priest in France bade her do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As the word &quot;priest&quot; rose to his mind he started with a new
thought.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who were the others,&quot; he whispered, &quot;she said who knew of it?
Louis, the king! Almost it seems impossible. Then, next, the woman--his
wife--Madame! Also La Chaise and Chamillart. La Chaise, a bigot--Chamillart, the
man they speak of as  <i>une fine lame!</i> They all know it, and will keep the
secret well. What was it she said? 'They will never tell.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Once more from St. Eustache close at hand the hour rolled
forth; almost it seemed as if the deep boom of the great bell echoed in his ears
the words he had repeated to himself, &quot;They will never tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will they not?&quot; he mused again. &quot;Will they not? Neither
Louis, nor his wife, nor the priest, nor the scheming politicians. Will never
tell! Therefore all search must be unavailing. Yet--yet---we will see. Only,
even though I should find him, even though I forced from one of them the
acknowledgment that he still lived, was the true heir, would he himself consent
to take what is his? The man who wrote that letter in bygone years will not have
grown softer, more easily persuaded by now. Yet I will make some attempt.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He sought his bed now, and once there, still lay awake for
some time longer, musing and meditating on the secret which had been confided to
him; wondering, too, if what he was doing was owing absolutely to a
determination to right a great wrong, or, instead, was only the outcome of that
strong, latterly-embraced Protestantism of his, which, through this embrace, now
caused him to desire to outwit these scheming papists. Yet he might have found
the answer by studying his own feelings, his own resolves, arrived at the moment
he learned of the hidden secret of the great family to which he was allied. For
if he held his tongue now it was easily enough to be supposed that all which he
had inherited from the dead woman would at once be made over to him. If he spoke
on the subject of the lawful inheritor, not one jot of the fortune that woman
had left him would ever come his way.</p>

<p class="normal">Only he did not so reflect, did not remember, or, remembering,
did not hold that he was ruining himself in his determination not so much to
outwit the Romish Church and its principal adherents as to set right the
horrible wrong that had been committed--committed, in the first place, by the
real de Rochebazon himself toward his children by the renunciation of all that
he should have guarded for them; in the second place, by those who were only too
willing to assist in depriving him, whom they doubtless termed the heretic, of
what was his.</p>

<p class="normal">He rose the next morning with his mind made up as to what
should be his future course, as to what, from this very day, he would set about
doing. Rose, calm and collected, knowing that he had undertaken a task that must
deprive him of that inheritance which by his silence alone might easily be his;
a task that might, in the state of autocratic government which prevailed in
France, lead him to a violent end.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet his mind was made up. He would not falter. Never. Even
though he should find the last de Rochebazon still as firmly set in his
determination as he had been in long-past years; even though when found, if
ever, he should spurn him from his threshold with curses for having unearthed
him, still he would do it. To right the wrong! To repay in some way all that he
had already received from this family--his education, the luxury that had
accompanied his earlier days, the profusion of ease and comfort showered on him
by one who, in very truth, had no right to appropriate one crown or pistole of
that family's wealth. He would do it! To right the wrong!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where,&quot; he said, sending for the  <i>maître d'hôtel</i>, who
presented himself at once before him, already clothed in decorous black, &quot;where,
do you know, is Madame de Maintenon now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know not, monsieur, unless it be at St. Cyr. She is much
there now; almost altogether.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can you ascertain?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will endeavour to do so, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was to her that, after the reflections of the night, he had
determined to address himself. To her, knowing full well even as he did so, the
little likelihood which existed of his obtaining any information. Had not the
woman now lying dead upstairs said that she, among the others, would never tell?</p>

<p class="normal">Only it was not altogether with the desire to obtain
information that he was about to seek her. Instead, perhaps, to volunteer some,
to tell her that he knew the secret of the manner in which the existence of
Cyprien de Beauvilliers had been ignored for many years; to see if there was no
possibility of moving her to help in the deed of justice.</p>

<p class="normal">She was spoken of by some as God's chosen servant in France,
as a woman who was rapidly bringing a corrupt king, a corrupt court, a corrupt
land into a better path--a path that should lead to salvation.</p>

<p class="normal">Surely, surely she would not be a partner in this monstrous
act of injustice, a participator in this monstrous lie.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_06" href="#div1Ref_06">CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;LA FEMME, MALHEUREUSEMENT SI FAMEUSE, FUNESTE ET TERRIBLE.&quot;--ST. SIMON.</h5>

<p class="normal">Once past Versailles, and St. Cyr was almost reached, the
horse which Martin Ashurst had ordered to be made ready for him that morning
bearing its rider easily and pleasantly along. Almost reached, yet still a
league off, wherefore the young man once more set about collecting his thoughts
ere that distance should be compassed. Arranged once more in his own mind the
manner in which he would approach &quot;Madame,&quot; if she would consent to receive him.</p>

<p class="normal">After much consideration, after remembering, or perhaps it
should better be said never forgetting, that what he was about to do might so
envelop him in perils that his life would not be worth a day's--nay, an
hour's--purchase, he had decided that he would be frank and truthful--that was
it, frank and truthful--before this woman who was now the king's wife, this
woman who held the destinies of all in France in the hollow of her hand almost
as much as they were held in the hand of Louis.</p>

<p class="normal">He would plainly tell what he knew, or thought he knew; would
seek confirmation of that knowledge from her into whose house, to whose
presence, he was determined, if possible, to penetrate.</p>

<p class="normal">If she would consent to receive him!</p>

<p class="normal">Only--would she?</p>

<p class="normal">He knew that, by all report, even by such gossip as penetrated
as far as London, where she was much discussed in not only political but also
general circles, an audience with her was as difficult to be obtained as with Le
Dieudonné himself; that, with few exceptions, none outside the charmed circle of
the royal children, her own creatures, and her own ecclesiastics, were ever able
to penetrate to her presence. Nay, had he not even heard it said that those on
whom she poured benefits could never even obtain a sight of her? that her
especial favourites, the Duchesse du Maine, the brilliant Marshals Villars,
Tallard, and d'Harcourt, could get audience of her only with difficulty? And
these were her friends, and he was--she might well deem that he was--her enemy.</p>

<p class="normal">All the same he was resolved to see her if it were possible.</p>

<p class="normal">His dead kinswoman had been her friend, surely his passport
was there--in that.</p>

<p class="normal">He reached the outer gate of St. Cyr even as the clock set
high above it struck one, and addressing himself to a soberly clad man servant,
who was standing by the half-open gateway which led into a courtyard, he asked
calmly if &quot;Madame&quot; was visible--if it was permissible for him to see her?</p>

<p class="normal">Then, at first, he feared that he had indeed come upon a
bootless errand, for the grave and decorous servitor showed in his face so deep
an astonishment at the request, so blank an appearance of surprise, that he
thought the answer about to issue from the man's lips could be none other than
one of flat refusal.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame,&quot; he answered, in, however, a most respectful tone,
&quot;sees no one without an appointment. If monsieur has that she will doubtless
receive him, or if he bears a message either from his Majesty or the Duc du
Maine. Otherwise----&quot; and he shrugged his shoulders expressively.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have none such,&quot; Martin replied, &quot;nor have I any
appointment. Yet I earnestly desire to see Madame. I am the nephew of--of--the
Princesse de Rochebazon, who died yesterday. She was Madame's friend. If I can
be received upon that score I shall be grateful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At once he saw that, as it had been before--upon, for
instance, his journey from the coast toward Paris--so it was now. That name, his
connection with that great and illustrious family, opened barriers which might
otherwise have been closed firmly against him, removed obstacle after obstacle
as they presented themselves.</p>

<p class="normal">The look upon the man's face became not more respectful, since
that was impossible, but less hard, less inflexible; then he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If monsieur will give himself the trouble to dismount and
enter the courtyard his name shall be forwarded to Madame. Whether she will
receive monsieur it is impossible for me to say. Madame is now about to take her  <i>
déjeûner d'après midi</i>. But the name shall be sent.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Therefore Martin Ashurst, feeling that at least he was one
step nearer to what he desired, dismounted from his horse, and resigning it to a
stableman who was summoned, entered the courtyard of the château, or
institution, as it was more often termed, of St. Cyr. An institution where the
strange woman who ruled over it brought up and educated, and sometimes dowered,
the daughters of the nobility and gentry to whom she considered something was
due from her.</p>

<p class="normal">At first he thought this courtyard had been constructed in
imitation of some tropical garden or hothouse, so oppressive was the heat caused
in it by the total exclusion of all air--a heat so great that here rich exotics
grew in tubs as they might have grown in the soil of those far distant lands,
notably Siam, from which they had been brought by missionaries as presents to
their all-powerful mistress. Then he remembered that among other things peculiar
to this woman was her love of warmth and her hatred of fresh air--perhaps the
only subject on which she was at variance with Louis. And sitting there in the
warm, sickly atmosphere, waiting to know what reception, if any, might be
accorded him, he wondered how the king, whose love of open windows and of the
cool breezes which blew across the woods and forests of his various palaces and
châteaux was proverbial, could ever contrive to pass as much of his life as he
did in the confined and vaporous air which perpetually surrounded his wife.</p>

<p class="normal">As thus he reflected there came toward him an elderly lady,
preceded by the servitor who had received him--a woman dressed in total black,
whom at first he thought might be Madame de Maintenon herself, would have felt
sure that it was she had not the newcomer, bowed--nay, courtesied to him--as she
drew; near, while she spoke in a tone of civil deference which he scarcely
thought one so highly placed as the king's unacknowledged wife would have used.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame will receive monsieur,&quot; this lady said very quietly,
in a soft, almost toneless voice, &quot;if he will follow me. Also she will be
pleased if he will join her at her  <i>déjeûner</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is Mademoiselle Balbien,&quot; the servitor said, by way of
introduction of this ancient dame, &quot;Madame's most cherished attendant.&quot; Whereon
Martin bowed to the other with a grace which she, &quot;attendant&quot; though she might
be, returned with as much ease as though her life had been passed in courts from
the days of her long-forgotten infancy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur may have heard of me,&quot; the old lady chirped
pleasantly as now she motioned Martin to follow her, smiling, too, while she
spoke. &quot;The Princesse de Rochebazon knew me very well indeed--alas, poor lady,
and she is dead!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, Martin had heard of her, and from his aunt, too, as well
as others. Had heard of her deep devotion to the woman who now ruled not only
France but France's king--had heard, in truth, that the De Maintenon might have
been dead long years ago of starvation, of bitter, pinching want, had it not
been for this faithful creature. Had heard his aunt tell, when inclined to
gossip, of how Nanon Balbien had taken Scarron's widow to her garret after the
death of the bankrupt and poverty-stricken poet; had shared her bed and her
daily meal--generally a salted herring and some bread--with the woman now
omnipotent in France; had preserved her life thereby and prevented her
succumbing to cold and destitution and starvation. Knew, too, that there were
those in France who said that in so doing Nanon Balbien had unwittingly
perpetrated the greatest sin, the greatest evil, against the land that was
possible. That it would have been better had she left the object of her charity
to die in the gutters of the street than to preserve her life, and thereby raise
up and nourish the snake which sucked the life blood from France and all within
it.</p>

<p class="normal">Still following this old woman, through corridors from which
all air was as equally excluded as from the glass-roofed courtyard they had
left--corridors, too, in which there stood in niches alabaster busts of saints,
and one, with above it a sacred light, of the Figure itself--Martin Ashurst went
on, until at last he and his conductor neared a huge ebony door the handle of
which was of massive silver and representing an angel's head--a door outside
which there stood four ladies in waiting, all dressed in black, none of them
young, and one only passably good-looking, yet whom he divined to be women of
the oldest and best blood in France, and divined rightly, too. Three of them
were high-born noblemen's daughters, one the daughter of a prince--De Rohan.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mademoiselle de Rochechouart,&quot; said Martin's guide, &quot;this is
the gentleman. Will you conduct him to Madame?&quot; and she drew back now, resigning
the visitor to the lady whom she addressed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come, monsieur,&quot; that lady said, her voice soft and low,
&quot;follow me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later and he stood before the marvellous woman, the
Protestant woman born in a prison, now a bigoted papist and a king's wife. Yet
Martin remembered only at the moment the words of his dead kinswoman, &quot;Madame
knows it.&quot; Remembered, too, how she had said of her that she was one who would
never tell.</p>

<p class="normal">Almost he thought that she had but just risen from the  <i>
prie Dieu</i>
which stood beneath another figure of the Saviour that was placed in a niche
here, as was its fellow in the corridor; that she had been engaged in prayer
while awaiting the moment when he should be conducted to her presence. Thought
so, yet doubted. For if she knew, if she divined upon what errand he had come,
would she, even she, this reputed mask of duplicity, of self-righteous deceit,
be praying on her knees at such a moment? Or, for so also he thought in that
swift instant, was she seeking for guidance, beseeching her God to cleanse and
purify her heart, to give her grace to speak and to reveal the truth?</p>

<p class="normal">But now she stood there calm, erect, notwithstanding her
sixty-five years of life, waiting for him to be brought to her, for his
approach. Yet not defiantly or arrogantly--only waiting.</p>

<p class="normal">The murmured words of Mademoiselle de Rochechouart served as
introduction; the courtly bow of Martin Ashurst made acknowledgment of his
presentation, then she spoke:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My tears, my prayers, my supplications for Aurore de
Rochebazon,&quot; she said--and he marvelled that her voice was so low and sweet, he
having imagined, he knew not why, that it should be harsh and bitter--&quot;have been
offered up many times since I have heard of her death. Monsieur, I accept as a
favour at your hands that you have ridden from Paris to see me here. Doubtless
you knew that I should be soothed to hear of the end she made. Is it not so,
monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is so to some extent, madame. Yet, if you will be so
gracious, there are other matters on which I shall crave leave to address you,
if I have your permission.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You shall have full permission to speak as it may please you.
Yet, first, you have ridden from Paris. Also it is my hour for the midday
repast. Monsieur,&quot; and she put out her silk mittened hand, &quot;your arm.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And taking it she led him through a heavily-curtained door
into an adjoining room. Within that room, sombrely furnished, dark, too, and
somewhat dismal because of the ebony fittings and adornments, was a table with
covers for two. Also upon it a silver gong. And, alone to relieve the gloom of
all around, there stood upon it also a rich
<i>épergne</i>, filled almost to overflowing with rich luscious fruit--peaches,
choice grapes, and nectarines.</p>

<p class="normal">At first Madame said nothing, or little, to Martin Ashurst
beyond the ordinary speech of a courteous hostess to a stranger guest; also
Mademoiselle de Rochechouart and a waiting maid were always present, the former
standing behind the mistress's chair and directing the latter by a glance. But
at last the  <i>déjeûner</i> drew to a conclusion, the meal of few but extremely
choice  <i>plats</i> was finished, and two little handleless cups of coffee
(which Madame de Maintenon never concluded any meal whatever without) were
placed in front of hostess and guest. Then they were alone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; she said, her deep eyes fixed upon Martin, &quot;now tell me
of the end which Aurore de Rochebazon made. Tell me all--all--her last words.
They were those of one at peace, I pray.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her voice was sweet and low as she spoke, yet not more calm
than that of the man who sat before her, as he answered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame, it is to tell you of her last words that I have
sought your presence. Yet, alas----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alas!&quot; she repeated quickly. &quot;Alas! Why do you say that?
Alas--what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Her last words were scarce those of peace. Instead, the words
of one whose end was not peaceful; of one who wandered--was distraught--or
revealed in her dying moments a secret that should have been divulged long,
years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The ivory of his listener's face did not become whiter as he
spoke, neither to her cheeks did any blood mantle. There was no sign that in the
mind of this, woman, marble alike in look and heart, was any knowledge of what
the revealed secret was, or only one such sign. A duller glance from the deep
sunken eyes, as though a film had risen before them and hidden them from him who
gazed at her. Then she said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Doubtless she wandered. Was distraught, as you say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, madame. For she left behind her
proofs--letters--testifying----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That my aunt was not the Princesse de Rochebazon. That,
instead, she and her husband usurped a position which was never theirs. That a
deep wrong had been done which must, which shall be, righted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By me, with God's grace.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">The night was falling as he rode back to Paris and entered the
city by the western gate, making his way to the Rue Champfleury.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet neither the challenge of the  <i>guet</i> at the barrier
nor the noise inside it when once he was within the city, nor the crowd waiting
outside a theatre to witness a revival of L'Écolier de Salamanque, which was the
production of the poor decayed creature who had been the first husband of the
inscrutable woman he had visited that day, had power to rouse him from his
thoughts, nor to drive from out his memory her last words:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Even if all this were true you will never find him. Even
though he lives you will never succeed.&quot;</p>

<h5>THE HOUSE BY THE BRIDGE.</h5>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; said Martin to the trembling pastor, &quot;come. We may do
something, avert some awful calamity. You are of their faith. They will listen
to you,&quot; and he arranged his  <i>porte épée</i> and motioned to the old man to
follow him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not you! Not you!&quot; the other whispered, shuddering. &quot;Not you!
You know not what will befall you if you take part in this.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I. I must go too. I am a Protestant as much as they. I
tell you, Pastor Buscarlet, I will wear the mask no longer. Come. Hark! There is
firing. Come. We can do nothing here. Help neither Huguenot nor Papist.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On my knees I beseech you to stop,&quot; the old man said,
flinging himself upon them before Martin, &quot;on my knees. You know not what you
do. Think, think! If these men have risen it is at the worst but Frenchmen
against Frenchmen. But with you--you are English. And we are at war again. Oh! I
sicken with dread that it should be known.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It can never be known. I have the French as well as you, or
they--better than they, for mine is the speech of Paris and theirs of the
mountains. Hark! they sing of Judah once more--also there is firing. Come with
me or let me go alone.&quot; And he tore himself from the hands of the other.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet he did not go alone; even as he stepped into the garden
the pastor went with him, running by his side to keep pace with his eager
strides, whispering, entreating as he did so.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Promise me, promise me, Martin,&quot; he said, &quot;that you will take
no part in any fray that is happening, will not to-night proclaim yourself. Oh,
promise me! Remember,&quot; and he sunk his quavering voice even still lower,
&quot;Cyprien de Beauvilliers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Recalled to himself by that name, recollecting the atonement
of many years that had yet to be made, the wrong that had to be righted, as he
himself had said, he too sunk his own voice, saying: &quot;I promise. To-night I do
nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Down the street they went, therefore, together, Buscarlet's
hand in Martin's, both glancing at the closed windows of the thatched houses and
seeing the lights in them, with white faces against the mica panes and dark eyes
gleaming from behind curtains, yet with no head showing. The orders to keep
within doors were being followed.</p>

<p class="normal">In all the street (there was but one) no form was visible; if
it had not been for the uproar at the end of it, where Le Tarn rolled under the
three small bridges, and for the spits and tongues of flame that belched forth
out of musketoons and carabines from the windows of the &quot;house by the bridge,&quot;
beneath the deeper, denser flames that rolled from under the eaves of that
house, they might have deemed it was a deserted village or one peopled only with
the dead.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet again the solemn chant uprose as they drew close to that
house, but mingled now with something deeper than itself--the hammering of great
trees, or tree trunks, on doors, the rumbling of flames escaping from the
burning house, the firing from the windows, the loud shrieks from within the
house itself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are you?&quot; cried a huge man as they entered the crowd,
&quot;Papist or Protestant? Child of God or Devil? Answer, or----&quot; then ceased,
seeing Buscarlet still holding Martin's hand; ceased and murmured, &quot;Pardon,
reverend; I did not see or know in the darkness. Yet begone; seek a safer place.
The villain has his house full of De Broglie's fusileers to fire on us and help
him. Oh, Lord of Hosts, wilt thou let them help such as he?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What will you--they--do?&quot; Martin asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Release the prisoners. If he resists, slay him. We have
suffered too long.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; said Buscarlet, &quot;that must not be. Murder must not
be done; or, if done, not by our side. Let the shedding of blood be theirs----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It has been for too long,&quot; the Cévenole answered sternly, his
eyes glittering. &quot;It has been. Now it is our turn. What saith the Scriptures?
'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' So be it! The Papists have shed
blood--our blood--like water; now let them look to themselves. You know, father,
that the downtrodden have risen. At last!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God help us all!&quot; Buscarlet exclaimed, wringing his hands.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, God help us all! Yet even he can not give us back our
dead--those who have hung in chains on the bridges of Montpellier, Nîmes,
Anduse, even here upon this bridge of Montvert. What balm is there for our
daughters whipped to death through the streets, our sons sent to the galleys
without trial, our pastors--your brethren--broken on the wheel, burnt at the
stake? We have risen; it will not end here. That great evil king still sits in
his great white palace, his reformed wanton by his side; she is old now, yet she
shall not es----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He staggered as he spoke, flung out his arms, then fell
heavily to the ground to the sound of a fresh discharge of musketry. The
fusileers of De Broglie had fired another volley from the windows of the abbé's
house, and a bullet had found the man's heart.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; said Martin, &quot;come. We can do naught here. I may not
draw my sword. No use to be mowed down here. Let us gain the bridge; there are
no windows which give on that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Half supporting, wholly leading the unhappy old man, he made
his way through the besiegers who remained outside the house, some still singing
their psalms and hymns of praise, while amid them moved the inspired ones, the
prophets--men who were crazed with religious fervour and maddened with
persecution until they did, in truth, believe that they were appointed by Heaven
to direct and guide the others.</p>

<p class="normal">Also among this mass of infuriated peasants, some of whom fell
or staggered away as fresh discharges came from the house, were three persons
who had been brought from out of it. One, bent double from long confinement in
the stocks, was Masip, of whom Buscarlet had spoken. The second was a girl not
over sixteen, who screamed, &quot;My back, my back, O God, my back!&quot; if any touched
her. She had been thrashed daily, because she would not be converted, by thongs
steeped in pitch which had been allowed to harden ere the abbé used the whip.
The third was an old man who could not stand, and with an arm broken.</p>

<p class="normal">Gaining the bridge, Martin and Buscarlet saw a fresh sight of
horror.</p>

<p class="normal">The roof of the house was alight now. From between the walls
and where the eaves of thatch hung over, bubbles and puffs of flame burst out
and leaped toward the thatch itself, each tongue flickering higher until at last
the ends of straw glowed and sparkled, then caught and began to burn. And on the
sloping roof was a man crouching, his heels dug tight into the dried straw and
reeds to prevent him from slipping down and over into the garden beneath, while
with his hands he frantically twisted round a chimney stack a coil of white rope
which another man, clinging himself to the roof, handed to him.</p>

<p class="normal">It was the abbé and his valet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Could we but save them,&quot; Buscarlet whispered, &quot;but save them!
Return evil with good, repay his persecutions with Christian charity and mercy.
Oh, that we might!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing can save them,&quot; Martin replied, watching the men's
actions in the gleam of the flames from below, and also in the light of the now
fast-rising moon. &quot;Nothing. They are doomed. If they stay there they must be
burned to death; if they descend it is only to be caught; also if seen now,
those below will shoot them like sparrows on the roof. All are lost who are in
that house--all! The soldiers too!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had judged right. Both men were doomed.</p>

<p class="normal">Infuriated by still further fusillades from De Broglie's
soldiers by which two more men were killed, maddened, too, by the sight of the
abbé's victims, some of whom were lying on the ground from inability to stand,
the rioters determined to make an end of their first act of revenge. From the
chapel, therefore, in the vicinity--into which they had also broken by now--they
fetched the benches on which the worshippers sat, as well as the altar-rails and
the pulpit, and piled them up in the old square hall of the house, thereby to
add fuel to the flames. And also from the living rooms in that house they took
the furniture and flung it on too, not even forgetting the straw mattresses
which the soldiers had brought with them when the abbé applied to Nîmes for a
guard, saying that he feared an attack, and on which they slept nightly.</p>

<p class="normal">The house was doomed.</p>

<p class="normal">Paralyzed with fear, terror-stricken and horrified, Buscarlet
could bear the sight no longer. His white hair streaming in the night breeze, he
rushed into the midst of the Camisards, screaming to them to show mercy, begging
them to desist, imploring them to forget their own sufferings in the past, and
to save the abbé and all within the house. Yet his appeal touched not one single
heart.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Away, old man,&quot; said one of the inspired prophets, &quot;away to
your bed and out of this. The hour for mercy is gone; the servants of the Lord
have arisen. Go preach to women and babes; leave us, the priests of men, to deal
with men,&quot; and as he spoke he dragged Buscarlet out of the crowd, telling Martin
also to beware lest he interfered.</p>

<p class="normal">The latter was nigh doing so now. Protestant as he was, with,
in his heart, a hatred for the cruelties which he knew the Papists practised
here in Languedoc--cruelties condemned, indeed, by many of their brother Roman
Catholics, so terrible were they--he could yet scarce keep his hand from his
sword hilt, scarce forbear rushing into that burning house and endeavouring to
save Du Chaila's life.</p>

<p class="normal">For now the end was very near. If the man was not saved soon
his final hope was gone. The soldiers had fired their last shots, their
powder-horns and cartouches were empty, they were endeavouring to escape, some
leaping from the lower windows at which they, fortunately for themselves, had
been stationed, and plunging into the little river and across it; some rushing
out into the crowd of fierce Cévenoles, only to be cut down to the earth by
reaping hooks and scythes, or, more happily, to escape with wounds alone. There
were none left now in the burning house but the abbé and his man-servant. On the
former all eyes were fixed, the crowd drawing farther back from the dwelling to
get a fairer view of the roof on which they could see him still crouched, or
moving on to the bridge, thereby the better to observe his fate. And they
gloated over it--these miserable peasants who had turned at last, these human
downtrodden worms who had not been allowed to practise their religion in peace
in their own land, nor permitted to emigrate to others where they might do so;
they fed themselves full with revenge on this the first night of their uprising.
One, a marksman, raised his carabine and covered Du Chaila as he clung to the
roof--maybe his heart was not yet entirely warped nor turned to the deepest
tinge of cruelty, and he wished to end the wretch's sufferings--but it was
knocked up by half a dozen strong arms. A dozen voices cried fiercely:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Help him not, assist him to no easy death. Remember our
brothers' dooms, our fathers in the flames, our girls' backs raw and bleeding.
Observe Fleurette lying there at your feet; let him expiate all. Then, after
him, the others. There are more to suffer too. Baville--ho, Baville!--<i>le Roi
de Languedoc</i>, as he is termed--the prior of St. Maurice--the priest of
Frugéres--it is their turn to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And above the roar of the flames these louder roars of
threatened vengeance rose; above all else their psalms were heard telling how
Jehoshaphat exhorted the people, how Jahaziel prophesied, and how the God of
Battles had delivered the enemy into their hands.</p>

<p class="normal">The end was near.</p>

<p class="normal">Du Chaila, the cruellest priest in the Cévennes--the man who,
under the office of Inspector of Roman Catholic Missions in Languedoc, had for
sixteen years perpetrated cruelties on the Protestants which, it was said in the
district, he could have only learned while a missionary in Siam--was about to
expiate his merciless rigour on others.</p>

<p class="normal">Part of the eaves overhanging the garden had by now fallen
away in great masses of charred straw. One of two things alone could happen
soon: either he must perish in the flames when the roof fell in, as it would do
in a few moments, or he must escape from that roof. It was the latter which he
prepared to attempt, hoping perhaps that even now he might do so without his
intentions being known.</p>

<p class="normal">Slowly, therefore, he crept away from the spot where he had
crouched so long. They could see his hands and feet thrust deep into the thatch
at each move he made. He disappeared from their sight, yet for a moment only;
for as he left the side of the house where the rioters were, so those rioters
followed below in the road. Compactly, in a mass, all went together, and
silently. Their voices, their hymns had ceased; but for their footfalls there
was naught to tell of how they were tracking the man from beneath as he himself
moved above. Like sleuth-hounds who make no noise as they follow their trail,
yet follow it unerringly, these human sleuth-hounds followed him.</p>

<p class="normal">They passed round the house, they stood upon the slope leading
to the bridge. Between them and the house itself there ran a thick-set privet
hedge, separating the latter from the road and shielding the lower rooms on that
side from the dusts of summer and the snows of winter. Now, on this July night,
convolvuli and roses and honeysuckle twined about it, dotting the deep green
with many a delicate blossom and emitting sweet perfumes on the air. And above
this hedge, between it and the roof, the doomed man was hanging at this time,
clinging to a rope made of twisted bedclothes, wrenched, doubtless, from the
beds of the upper rooms.</p>

<p class="normal">None spoke in all that crowd, no hymn was sung. Save for the
sobs of Buscarlet and the moans of Fleurette, who lay in her sister's arms, no
sound broke the silence--none until, a second later, while all their eyes were
turned up to that frantic figure and while the moon's rays glistened on their
eyeballs, a piercing shriek broke the stillness and the abbé fell headlong some
thirty feet into the hedge, bounding off from one of the stakes, that supported
it at intervals, into the dusty road; then lay there groaning. The roughly and
hastily constructed rope had given way, and in his fall, as was soon seen, his
leg was broken.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Spare me!&quot; he moaned--he who had never yet spared one, man,
woman, or child--&quot;spare me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At first none answered him, none spoke. Then amid the silence,
from the lips of Pierre Esprit, the chief of the three prophets, the words fell:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are lost--your body in this world, your soul in the
next.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alas!&quot; he wailed, &quot;even though I have damned myself, will you
too do the same thing by murdering me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His words were the signal for his doom.</p>

<p class="normal">They rushed at him as he lay there and plunged their knives
into his body, one man exclaiming, &quot;This for my mother, burned at Nîmes,&quot;
another, &quot;This for my father, broken at Anduse&quot;; a third, &quot;This for my brother,
sent to the galley, '<i>Le Réquin</i>'&quot;; a fourth, &quot;This for my sister,
Fleurette, lying here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">When his nephew, Le Marquis du Chaila, afterward recovered his
body from where they left it, it was pierced by fifty-two wounds, of which
twenty-four were mortal.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The beginning has been made,&quot; Pierre Esprit exclaimed. &quot;There
must be no backsliding. Henceforth each man's hand to guard each man's life. Now
for the prior of St. Maurice, next for the priest of Frugéres. While for those
who have been rescued from that man's clutches, away with them to the mountains
and safety. Come, let us sing unto the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And up the slopes and pastures of the purple hills encircling
the little village rose once more the chant of the army of Jehoshaphat.</p>

<p class="normal">Soon none were left in the blood-stained road but the pastor,
Buscarlet, lying where he had fainted, and Martin Ashurst, white to the lips and
endeavouring to arrange the dead man's limbs into something resembling humanity.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_08" href="#div1Ref_08">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>

<h5>AN EXODUS.</h5>

<p class="normal">In the coming dawn, when the stars had paled and died away,
and when far off, where the Basses Alpes lifted their heads eastward, the gray
light turned into daffodil and told that the day was at hand, Martin carried the
pastor back into his little house.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Rest,&quot; he said, &quot;rest, and endeavour to sleep. I pray Heaven
you may do so, after this night of horror.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Horror indeed!&quot; Buscarlet said, sinking into the old
leather-covered
<i>fauteuil</i> that for years he had sat in so calmly and happily, though
solitary. &quot;Horror undreamed of!&quot; Then, a moment later, he went on: &quot;I
thought--nay, I knew--that they would rise at last and throw off the hideous
yoke under which they bowed. Yet I deemed it would but be to release those of
our religion who suffered, to prevent others from suffering too; to demand
terms, even though only such terms as would permit us to seek peace in far-away
lands; but never dreamed of such deeds as we have witnessed to-night. Where will
it end? And how?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There were those who muttered in that crowd,&quot; Martin replied,
his face still of a deathly pallor, &quot;that it might not end until they stood
outside Louis' gates--were within them. And there were some who seemed to know
of what they spoke. Some who have been long leagues away from this lonely valley
shut in by these mountains--men who know that on all sides and on all her
frontiers France is sore beset. Crippled by her fresh war with Spain, the
attacks made on her on the Italian border, also by the Dutch on the Rhine.
Fighting as well my own countrymen in Bavaria and the whole length of the
Danube, even to the borders of Austria.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The mention of his own countrymen by Martin Ashurst seemed to
bring fresh trouble to the unhappy old man, to cause fresh terrors to spring
into his mind; for at those words he started in his chair and regarded the
younger one steadily, though with still upon his face the look of misery that
the events of the last few hours had brought forth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your own countrymen!&quot; he repeated, half-dazed. &quot;Your own
countrymen! Ay, ay,  <i>les Anglais!</i> Thank God, it is not known, and never
will be known, that you are either English or Protestant. Baville would not
spare you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Baville need not perhaps know that I am an Englishman,&quot;
Martin replied calmly. &quot;But one thing he will most assuredly know ere long, when
he begins to make inquiry into the doings of this past night--namely, that I am
a Protestant.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Know it!&quot; Buscarlet exclaimed, trembling even more than
before, clasping his hands frenziedly as though overcome by a fresh fear. &quot;How
should he know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall announce it. For a certainty, shall not disguise it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Martin, Martin,&quot; the old man moaned, &quot;are you mad? Do you
value your life so little, desire so much the horrors of the wheel, the flames,
to have your head upon this bridge as others' heads have been, that you will
acknowledge this? Martin, for the love of God, pause. Think of what such an
acknowledgment would mean to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have thought all through the night, even while I watched
that man's house burned beneath him as he hid on the roof; while I saw him done
to death. And, thus thinking, became resolved. Henceforth no power on earth, no
horror of awful death, of mutilation after death, can make me disguise, keep
back the acknowledgment of the form of faith I belong to----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alas, alas! it  <i>will</i> bring death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It may do so. If it does it must be borne. Yet, at the worst,
I will not think it can come to that. I am a Protestant; here, in your own land,
a Huguenot. Yet I am not one of those who slew the abbé. Shall never imbrue my
hands in blood. Ask only to be left in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alas,&quot; Buscarlet exclaimed again, &quot;that is all that we have
asked--all! Yet you see the end. The woman who dominates Louis allows no free
thought, no religion other than her own; has dragooned Huguenots into Roman
Catholicism since the day the Revocation was pronounced, has hung and burned and
broken those who refuse to change. How, then, can you hope to escape--you who
were among the crowd that performed last night's work?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I took no part in his murder. Would have saved him if I
could----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That will not save you. Martin, you must flee from here at
once. Escape out of France. Be gone while there is yet time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And de Rochebazon! His children's heritage! What of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as he uttered the words his determination to remain here
at all costs and in deadly peril seemed to act upon the old man's mind, to clear
his brain so clouded with the awful events of the past night, to bring back to
him the power of speaking and reasoning clearly, for slowly yet weightily he
answered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As that heritage has done before, so it must do now. Must
wait, remain in abeyance. This is no time to prosecute your search. No sense of
justice on your part toward a distant kinsman can demand that you should
sacrifice your own life, at the least your liberty. Moreover, remember, he or
his descendants may not be here in Languedoc; may be leagues away, in remote
lands, for aught you know; even in your own country, the home of the oppressed
since James fell.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They said at Geneva it was beyond all doubt that he who was
rightly the de Rochebazon came here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Grant that,&quot; the old man replied, calm now in face of the
argument he had to use, must use and drive home. &quot;Grant that--that he came here.
Well, it is nigh half a century ago. Where may he not have gone to in all that
long passage of years? The Huguenots are everywhere--in England, Germany,
Scotland, the Americas, Switzerland, some even on the far-off shores of the Cape
of Good Hope. Why stay here seeking for what is no better than a shadow, and at
the risk of your own life?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment it seemed as if his argument was about to
prevail. Into Martin Ashurst's face there came a look telling of deep
reflection--reflection that brought with it an acknowledgment of the force of
the other's words. And, observing, Buscarlet pressed his argument home.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If alive, de Rochebazon never intends to claim what is his.
If dead, he has died and kept his secret well. While if living he knows not,
possibly, that those who were deemed the Prince and Princess de Rochebazon have
passed away, yet also he knew that for years they usurped, although unwillingly,
the place that was his, the vast wealth. If you found him at last, even here,
could you force him to take back the heritage he renounced so long ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Still the other answered not. What could he say? On his face
was still the look of perplexity that had been there since first the pastor
spoke. And again the latter went on:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Moreover, granting even that--that--for his children's sake
he would return to the possession of his own, would emerge from the humble
position he has so long occupied--in France all Huguenots are humble now, here
in these mountains they are doubly so; few gentlemen of France acknowledge
themselves as such; all fear the court too much; if you found him, if he
consented, would he be allowed to return to what is his proper place and
position? You know the Romish Church which now holds all in its hands that once
was the de Rochebazon's. Will  <i>that</i>
ever disgorge? Would De Maintenon allow it to do so? You have seen her? Answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as Buscarlet mentioned that woman's name, Martin started.
Yes, he had seen her, and seeing, knew to what adamant he was opposed. Also he
recalled her words: &quot;You may seek yet you will never find, or, finding whom you
seek, will never prevail.&quot; Remembered, too, the look of confidence that had come
into the livid face of the woman before him and, as he remembered, wavered.</p>

<p class="normal">Was it imperative on him to do more than he had already done
in voluntarily renouncing all the wealth his aunt had put aside for him during
years of saving? Was he now to throw his life away in seeking for a shadow, a
chimera? For it was not beyond possibility, it was indeed most probable, that to
such a pass he might come.</p>

<p class="normal">At present he had committed no act which even the ruthless
Baville, of whom all in this portion of France spoke with bated breath--the
Intendant of the Province--could seize upon as a pretext for hostilities to him.
He had taken no part in the murder (or was it the execution?) of the Abbé du
Chaila; on the contrary, he had longed to render help to the unfortunate wretch,
though it had been beyond his power to do so. But--but--if he should remain in
the Cévennes, still seeking for a man who, in sober truth, might for years have
lain in his grave or might be, if still alive, at the other end of the world,
was it certain that he would not perform some act which would place him in
Baville's grasp? And as a Protestant, even though it was never known that he was
an Englishman, and standing, consequently, in hideous peril in France, what
chance would there be of his salvation?</p>

<p class="normal">Almost, as he reflected thus, he began to think that, if only
for a time and until these troubles had blown over, he must abandon his search
for the last of the de Rochebazons. This tempest which had arisen could not last
long, he thought; Louis could soon quell these turbulent mountaineers; then
again he could take up his task.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; he said to Buscarlet, sitting before him watching his
eyes and face to see what effect his words had on him, &quot;come. At least I will do
nothing without due thought. Will not be foolhardy. Now eat, drink something; it
will restore you. Then after that some rest.&quot; Whereupon he pointed to the table
on which were still the remains of the last night's little feast over which the
poor old man had tried to make so merry. &quot;Here is some of your famous trout
left,&quot; he said, struggling to speak cheerfully, &quot;and another bottle of the
Crépi. Come, let us refresh ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I feel as though I shall never eat again,&quot; Buscarlet
whispered. &quot;Never after the doings of the night--never! Oh, the horror of it,
the horror of it!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still cheer up,&quot; the other said, uttering words of hope which
he knew could have but little likelihood of being verified, yet striving thereby
to soften the old man's mental agony. &quot;This may be the end, as it has been the
beginning, on our--on the Protestant--side. When Baville, the persecutor, hears
that the harryings and the burnings and the murders--for that was a murder we
witnessed last night--are not to be on his part alone, he may pause. Nay, even
Louis, beset in every way, at every frontier, his treasury drained, may himself
give orders to stop these persecutions.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But Buscarlet only shook his head significantly, doubtingly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With that woman at his side, by his elbow, never!&quot; he
exclaimed. &quot;Nay, nay, my son, he will not stop them. He is the Scourge of God;
sweeps before him all who love God. He will never stop them. If he desired to do
so, she would not let him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">By now it was full daylight. Over the pastor's little garden
with its quaint, old-time flowers, among them many a sweet Provence rose opening
to the morning sun, that sun's rays streamed down. Also they knew that the
villagers were awake, if they had slept at all. Already they were calling to
each other, while some of them gathered in small groups and discussed the events
of the past night. Also all asked what would be the end of it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can not sleep,&quot; Buscarlet said; &quot;it is impossible. Let me
go forth. They are my people. I must be among them. Give them counsel. Oh, God
be thanked, there was not one of us in this hamlet who assisted in the work.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And he went out feebly through the window, Martin making no
attempt to prevent him, since he knew any such attempt must be futile. Instead,
therefore, he walked by his side.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whence,&quot; he asked, &quot;since none in the village took part in
the attack, did those men come? By their garb they are of the
mountains--goatherds, shepherds. Is it there the persecutions have been most
felt?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is there,&quot; the other answered, &quot;that those who have been
most persecuted have fled. We may not quit our unhappy country. Every port is
barred, every frontier road guarded. Where, therefore, should those whose homes
are desolate flee to, whose loved ones have been slaughtered, where but to the
mountains? There none can follow them or, following, can not find. Those
mountains are full of caverns made by Nature, God-given as a last resort of the
outcast and wretched.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They reached the open  <i>place</i> by the bridge as he
finished speaking; they stood outside the still burning remains of what had been
Du Chaila's house--the house seized by him from the man he had caused to be
hanged on the bridge, in front of the window from which the widow and orphans
looked daily until they too fled into the hills. Behind the hedge over which
grew the honeysuckle and convolvuli in such rich profusion, the hedge on to
which the doomed man had fallen, and on one of the stakes of which his leg had
been broken by the fall, they saw his body lying. Near it also they observed
other bodies which had been dragged from the smouldering ruins, one being that
of his valet, another that of his man cook, a third that of an ecclesiastic
named Roux who had acted as his secretary. Also they learned that two friends of
the dead man, themselves missionaries back from Siam, had been allowed to depart
after being found hidden under a cartload of straw.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are all of those others gone?&quot; Buscarlet asked, turning his
eyes away from the sight behind the lodge.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All are gone,  <i>mon père</i>,&quot; a man answered from the
crowd. &quot;<i>Pardie!</i>
it is best we all go too. By to-night the dragoons who have escaped will be back
from Alais. It is but ten leagues, and he (Baville) is there. Be sure more
soldiers will come with them; we shall be put to fire and sword. And for those
who are not slain--that!&quot; And the man pointed to the post on the apex of the
bridge on which the night lamp hung still alight, since none had remembered this
morning to put it out; on which, too, other things of a more fearful nature had
hung in all their recollections.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You hear?&quot; Buscarlet whispered to Martin. &quot;You hear?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I hear,&quot; the other replied, calmly as usual. Then asked,
&quot;Do you flee with them?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay,&quot; the old man replied. &quot;My place is here, by my church
which I am no longer permitted to enter--the church whose keys have been taken
from me after forty years. Yet I can not leave it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nor I you. I stay too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God help us all!&quot; the pastor said again, as he had said
before, and once more he wrung his hands. That his flock were going it was
impossible to doubt. They knew that henceforth Montvert was no abiding place for
them; that if they would not be ridden down or burned in their beds, or hung as
carrion on the bridge where when boys they had played, or taken to the jails of
Alais and Nîmes and Uzès, they must go, and go at once. Later, perhaps, they
might return, if it ever pleased God to soften the hearts of their persecutors.
But now, after the doings of the night, this was no longer a home for them.</p>

<p class="normal">History repeats itself; also events in one part of the world
resemble those occurring in the other. Even as in the old times before them, the
people of God had fled into the deserts of the East to escape the tyranny of
Pharaoh and of Ahab, even as the Covenanters had fled into the Pentland Hills,
so now the Protestants of the Cévennes fled into their mountains to escape the
persecutions of him whom they called the Scourge of God.</p>

<p class="normal">Peaceful, law-abiding men and women, asking only to be allowed
to worship their Maker in their own way, or, failing that, to depart for other
lands where they might do so unmolested, the refusal had turned them at last
into rebels, if not against the king, at least against his local
representatives--rebels who, having suffered long under the cruelties of their
persecutors, had now become cruel themselves.</p>

<p class="normal">For the torch of rebellion was lighted at last in all
Languedoc, and ere long it flamed fiercely. The &quot;Holy War&quot; had begun.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_09" href="#div1Ref_09">CHAPTER IX.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;BAVILLE! UN MAGISTRAT DONT LES EPOUVANTABLES RIGUEURS DOIVENT ÊTRE
SIGNALÉES À L'HORREUR DE LA POSTÉRITÉ.&quot;--SISMONDI.</h5>

<p class="normal">Night was near at hand again and all were gone--all except
Martin Ashurst and the pastor, both of whom sat now upon the bridge of Montvert,
their eyes fixed always on the crest of the hill which rose between the little
town and the larger one of Alais. For it was from that situation that they
expected to see at last the flash of sabres carried by the dragoons of de
Broglie and the foot soldiers of de Peyre, Lieutenant General of the Province,
to observe the rays of the setting sun flicker on their embrowned musketoon and
fusil barrels, and to hear the ring of bridle chain and stirrup iron. That they
would come on the instant that the intelligence reached Baville of what had been
done in Montvert over night it was impossible to doubt. And then--well, then,
possibly, since there were no human beings left to be destroyed except these two
men waiting there, the village would itself be demolished, burned to the ground.
Such vengeance had been taken only a week ago on a similarly deserted bourg from
which the inhabitants had fled, though silently and without revolt. It might be
expected that the same would happen here.</p>

<p class="normal">All were gone, the men, the women and children; the old, the
feeble, and the babes being carried by the stronger ones, or conveyed on the
backs of mules and asses. Also the cattle were removed--they would be priceless
in the mountain fastnesses; even the dogs had followed at their masters' heels;
upon those masters' shoulders and upon the backs of the animals the household
gods, the little gifts that had come to them on marriage days and feast days, on
christenings and anniversaries, had been transported.</p>

<p class="normal">The place was deserted except for those two men who sat there
wondering what would be their lot.</p>

<p class="normal">That vengeance would be taken on them neither deemed likely;
but that both would be haled before Baville they both felt sure. Buscarlet was
known to be one of the Protestant pastors who, from the day when the Revocation
of Nantes was promulgated seventeen years before, had fought strongly against
his congregation attending the Romish masses as the Government had ordered them
to do. He was a man in evil odour, though against him until the present time no
overt act could be charged. But now--now after the events of the past night,
with those dead Things lying there behind the hedge, what might he not be
accused of?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet,&quot; said Martin, as he leaned over the parapet of the
bridge, glancing sometimes up at the ridge which rose between Montvert and
Alais, expecting every moment to see the soldiers approaching, and sometimes
watching the long weeds in the river as they bent beneath its swift flow, &quot;yet
of what can you be accused? You interceded for him,&quot; and he directed his eyes in
the direction of the dead abbé, where he lay covered by a cloth, &quot;besought them
to show mercy, to return evil for good. Also those men, those  <i>attroupés</i>,
were not of this village nor of your flock. As well call you to account for the
invasion of a hostile army or foreign levy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But again Buscarlet only shook his head, then answered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, not of this village, nor of my congregation, but of the
same faith--Protestants! Therefore accursed in Baville's and his master's eyes.
That is enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke, from far up in the heights toward Alais they
heard the blare of a trumpet ring loudly and clearly on the soft evening air; a
moment later and, on the white road that ran like a thread through the green
slopes, they saw the scarlet coats of the horsemen gleaming; saw, too, a  <i>
guidon</i> blown out as its rider came forward against the wind; caught the
muffled sound of innumerable horses' hoofs. Then, next, heard orders shouted,
and a moment later saw a large body of dragoons winding down the hillside
slowly, while behind them on foot came the  <i>milices</i> of the province.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You see?&quot; Martin said as he watched them. &quot;Be calm. They can
do you no harm.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And he leaned over the bridge again and continued to observe
the oncomers.</p>

<p class="normal">Ahead of the main body, consisting of some hundred of cavalry
and an even larger number of Languedoc  <i>milice</i> or train bands, there rode
three men abreast. In the middle was one clad in a sober riding dress of dark
gray; the others on either side of him were rich in scarlet coats much guarded
with galloon, the evening sun flickering on the lace and causing it to sparkle
like burnished gold, and with large laced three-cornered hats in which also
their gold cockades shone, while he on the left wore the rich  <i>justaucorps à
brevet</i>, a sure sign not of a soldier of France alone, but of a soldier of
high social rank and standing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He in the middle,&quot; said Buscarlet, &quot;is Baville, the Scourge
of the Scourge. Be sure that when he comes with the soldiery the worst is to be
dreaded. That he deems his presence is necessary to insure fitting vengeance
being taken.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fear not,&quot; said Martin. &quot;They can not execute us here
to-night; afterward, inquiry will show that we have done nothing to deserve
their vengeance. Be calm.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Amid clouds of dust from the road on which no rain had fallen
for many days the cavalcade came onward, reaching at last the farther end of the
bridge from where these two men stood side by side; then the officer on the
right gave the orders for all following to halt, and slowly he with the other
two rode on to the bridge itself and up the slope to where Buscarlet and Martin
stood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the Lieutenant General, de Peyre,&quot; Buscarlet whispered.
&quot;The other is the Marquis du Chaila, the dead man's nephew. O God! what a sight
for him to see!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What has been done here?&quot; said Baville, looking down at the
two men on foot who stood close by where they had halted their horses, though
not until he and his companions had turned their eyes to the burned house, from
which little spiral wreaths of smoke rose vertically in the calm evening air.
&quot;What? And who, messieurs, are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The quiet tones of his full rich voice, the absence of all
harshness in it, almost startled Martin Ashurst. Was this the man, he
wondered--or could the pastor have been mistaken?--of whose cruelty to the
Protestants as well as his fierce and overbearing nature not only all the
province rang, but also other parts of the land far remote from here? The man
whose name was known and mentioned with loathing by the refugees in Holland and
Switzerland, in Canterbury and Spitalfields?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who are you, messieurs?&quot; he repeated quietly, &quot;though I think
I should know you, at least,&quot; and he directed his glance to the pastor.
&quot;Monsieur André Buscarlet,  <i>prédicateur</i> of the--the--so-called Reformed
Religion, if I am not mistaken.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;André Buscarlet,&quot; the old man replied, looking up at him; and
now, Martin observed, he trembled no more, but answered fearlessly, &quot;Protestant
minister of Montvert and----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where,&quot; exclaimed the young Marquis du Chaila, &quot;my uncle has
been barbarously murdered by you and your brood. Oh, fear not, you shall pay
dearly for it. Where, vagabond, is his body?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sir,&quot; said Martin, speaking for the first time, &quot;your grief
carries you into violent extremes. This gentleman whom you term 'vagabond' has
had no part nor share in your uncle's murder. Neither has his flock. The deed
was done by the refugees from the mountains. Monsieur Buscarlet attempted in
vain to prevent it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bah!&quot; exclaimed the marquis. &quot;You are another Protestant, I
should suppose. Valuable testimony! Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One who at least is not answerable to you. Suffice it that no
person in this village had any hand in the abbé's murder, that it was done by
the men of whom the pastor speaks.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To me, monsieur, at least all persons are answerable,&quot;
Baville interposed. &quot;I am the king's Intendant. I must demand your name and
standing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My name is----&quot; he began, yet ere he could tell it a shout
from the foremost dragoons who had dismounted startled all on the bridge. Some
of these men had been engaged in tethering their horses close by the hedge,
several of the animals indeed had already begun to crop the dusty grass that
grew beneath it, and they had found the bodies.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God, my God!&quot; the marquis almost shrieked as he bent over
the abbé's form, the soldiers having led him to where it lay after he had
hastily quitted the saddle. &quot;Oh, my God! my father's brother slaughtered thus.
Devils!&quot; he exclaimed, turning round and glancing up the long street, imagining
probably that the inhabitants were all within their houses. &quot;Devils! was not his
death enough, that you must glut your rage with such butchery as this? See,
Baville--see, de Peyre, the wounds in his body. Enough to kill twenty men.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Looking down from their saddles at the murdered man's form,
which they could observe very plainly over the hedge from the elevation at which
they were, the Intendant and the leader of the troops shuddered, the former
turning white beneath the clear olive of his complexion. Yet, even as Martin
observed him blench, he wondered why he should do so. Countless men and feeble
women and children had gone to the gibbet, the fire, the wheel, and the rack, as
well as to the galleys and the lash, at this man's orders, unless all Languedoc
and every Huguenot tongue lied. Why should he pale now, except it was because
this retaliation, this shifting of murder from the one side to the other, told
of a day of reckoning that had begun, of a Nemesis that had been awakened?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Baville,&quot; the young man cried again, &quot;Baville! Vengeance!
Vengeance! He has died slaughtered at his post, as he knew he would die. But
last week, at our house in Montpelier, he spoke of how he was doomed because he
served God. Baville!--de Peyre! give the orders to fall on, to destroy all.
Otherwise I make my way to the king of the north and cry on my knees for
vengeance on these accursed heretics, these bloodthirsty  <i>Protestants</i>, as
they term themselves. Burn down their hovels, I say; slaughter them,
exterminate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alas, unhappy man!&quot; exclaimed Buscarlet, still firm in his
speech now, and undaunted before the distracted marquis, who had already torn
his sword from its scabbard and stood before them gesticulating like a madman in
his grief and rage. &quot;What use to destroy empty houses, barren walls? Besides
ourselves there is no living soul left in all Montvert.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What!&quot; the two other men exclaimed together in their
surprise. &quot;What! All gone? None left?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And now on the Intendant's face there came another look, also
the return of his dark colour, as he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Gone, yet you proclaim their innocence. Tell us in one breath
that they are guiltless, in another that they have fled. Do the innocent flee?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They feared your cruelty. They knew that your Church spares
not the innocent; that it punishes them alike with the guilty.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Blasphemer!&quot; Baville exclaimed, though still his voice was
low and calm, belying the terrible accusation which lay beneath this word.
Terrible anywhere in France--now pious by law!--but doubly so in the Cévennes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I blaspheme not,&quot; Buscarlet said, waxing even bolder. &quot;Pause.
Look back. Twenty-seven Protestants have been done to death by you in the past
month----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Silence!&quot; the other ordered, still in his unruffled voice,
yet uttering words enough to affright the boldest, &quot;or I will have you gagged;
if that suffices not, strung up there,&quot; and he pointed to the lamp.</p>

<p class="normal">Then turning to the marquis, he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Be sure your uncle shall be avenged. Let them flee to the
mountains, yet we will have them. Extirpate them like rats in a granary. Julien,
the field marshal, has left Paris to assist in the holy work. Meanwhile, de
Peyre, send your men into every house in the place; see if this abandonment is
true. If not, if you find any, bring them before me. As for you, and you,&quot;
directing a glance at the pastor and Martin, &quot;you will sleep to-night in Alais.
To-morrow a court will be held.&quot; Then he added, under his breath, as though
talking to himself:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must be bold men. Otherwise you would have decamped too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Or innocent ones,&quot; Martin replied, hearing his words, low as
they were. &quot;You yourself have said it. Asked but now, 'Do the innocent flee?'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The Intendant bit his lips; the  <i>riposte</i> had gone
fairly home. Then, while de Peyre gave his orders and told off some of the
dragoons to enter and search every house in the village, and the marquis, who
was in command of the  <i>milices</i>, bade them take up the bodies carefully
and cover them decently with their capes, Baville glanced down at Martin,
saying:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur, I do not know you. You are not, I think, of this
locality. Yet I observe you are of the better classes. Where is your property?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In La Somme, department of the Ile de France. I am a
proprietor; the property of Duplan La Rose is mine, such as it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Had he not in truth been the owner of this property he would
have scorned to shelter himself beneath a falsehood. Had he been asked his faith
it was his fixed resolve to declare it, as, had it been possible for Baville to
recognise that he was an Englishman--which, after his earliest years being spent
in France, was not so--he had determined to avow his nationality, no matter what
the consequences might be. But so far the truth alone was necessary.</p>

<p class="normal">When his father waited long and eagerly for the time to come
for the Stuart Restoration--as no follower of the Stuarts ever doubted it would
come, sooner or later--he, hating Paris and all its garish dissipations under
the then young and immoral king (the king now so old and self-righteous!),
purchased this property from the Baron Duplan La Rose, a man himself broken and
ruined by his participation in the outbreaks of the Fronde. Purchased it because
all the Ile de France and the Pas de Calais were full of English refugees
waiting like himself for happier days to come; also because, when the time did
come, it would be near to England. And he dying, it became Martin's property.</p>

<p class="normal">Baville touched his hat as an acknowledgment of Martin's
explanation, perhaps also as an acknowledgment of his position, since he was a
great believer in  <i>les propriétaires</i> as men who were almost always
opposed to the murmurings and discontents of the  <i>canaille</i> and  <i>les
ordres bas</i>, such as the wretches belonged to who had massacred the abbé and
the others. And as he did so he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur is therefore a visitor here only--to--perhaps&quot;--and
his eyes rested piercingly on Martin--&quot;Monsieur Buscarlet?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur is,&quot; Martin replied, &quot;a visitor here seeking for a
lost person. A connection by marriage. A man who has been wronged, has partly
wronged himself. Monsieur has lodged with Monsieur Buscarlet before.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;May I demand the name of the lost man?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alas, monsieur, I do not know it. He discarded his own over
forty years ago. That which he has adopted I can not tell you. Also he may be
dead and my quest in vain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Would he be,&quot; and again his eyes stared fixedly into the eyes
of the other man, &quot;would he be, do you think, of--of--well--of Monsieur
Buscarlet's religious faith?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He would.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope you will find him, sir. If you do so, use your utmost
endeavours to persuade him to abjure that faith. Otherwise the province of
Languedoc will be no pleasant refuge for him henceforth, even though he has been
here for the forty years you speak of. Now, sir,&quot; and he left this subject to
speak of that which had brought him to Montvert, &quot;I must beg you will accompany
us to Alais. As a visitor to the neighbourhood and, as I suppose, a person not
interested in our unhappy local troubles, you can give us much information as to
how last night's murder was perpetrated. You are, I presume, willing to do so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am willing to speak as truthfully as I can on the matter.
To speak as I do now, when I tell you that neither Monsieur Buscarlet nor any of
the inhabitants of this place had any hand whatever in last night's doings.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall--the Court will be--glad to be assured of that,&quot;
Baville replied.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_10" href="#div1Ref_10">CHAPTER X.</a></h4>

<h5>THE LIGHTED TORCH.</h5>

<p class="normal">The night had come, and, with the exception of one troop of
dragoons and one company of the  <i>milices</i>, also with the exception of the
Marquis du Chaila, who had remained behind with the intention of having his
uncle's body properly interred, all were on their way to Alais.</p>

<p class="normal">And behind Baville and de Peyre rode Martin and Buscarlet, the
former on his own horse, the pastor on one which had belonged to the dead man.</p>

<p class="normal">It was a night such as those who dwell in the south--in
Languedoc, or Provence, or Dauphiné--in the height of its summer know well. A
night when, up from the Mediterranean, but a few leagues away, there come the
cool breezes that sunset invariably brings, and when, from the caps of the
purple mountains, the soft evening air descends, passing over cornfields and
meadows and woods after it has left the sterile and basaltic summits until, when
it reaches the valleys, its breath is perfumed and odorous. Summer nights so
calm and soft that here the nightingale remains later than is its wont in other
spots and sings sometimes far into August and September, the throats of hundreds
of birds making the whole valley musical.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, however, their trills were drowned by the clank of sabres
against the flanks of the horses bestridden by the dragoons, by the rattle of
chain and bridle, the occasional neigh of the animals, and by various orders
given as all went forward. Also by the hum of conversation as the men talked to
one another.</p>

<p class="normal">Suddenly upon the night air, however, there came now another
sound, silencing and deadening all else--a sound that subdued and deadened even
the clatter of harness and accoutrements, the voices of the men, the songs of
the birds of night. The sound of the deep booming of a bell not far off which
swelled and rose in the summer calm, as sometimes it rang violently and
sometimes slowly and intermittently, sometimes ceased, too, and then began
again, with sharp, hurried clangs, as though rung by some frightened,
terror-stricken hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the tocsin,&quot; one hoarse-throated dragoon called out,
who rode in the troop behind the leaders, &quot;the tocsin from some village church.
Is more murder being done? Are more abbés being slaughtered?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The fellow speaks truly,&quot; de Peyre said, then roared himself
at the top of his voice: &quot;Who among you knows the locality? What village is
near?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">From twenty mouths the answer came at once: &quot;It is Frugéres.
The place is close at hand. The steeple is the highest for miles around.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as these men spoke, their voices were in their turn
silenced or drowned by still more numerous shouts from others in the cavalcade.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;See, see!&quot; those other voices yelled. &quot;There is a fire--a
church that burns. Behold!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God!&quot; Martin heard Baville whisper to himself, though not
so low but that the words were distinguishable. &quot;The fanatics have attacked
another priest, another church. This is no riot, but a rebellion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he turned at once to de Peyre and said hurriedly but
authoritatively:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Order all forward. They are there. We may be in time to save
some. Also to trap these mountain wolves. Forward, I say! Give the word of
command.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">From de Peyre that word went forth, harsh and raucous as
bellowed from the lips of the rough soldier who had fought at Senef and
Ensisheim and had himself taken orders from Turenne and Condé. A moment later
every man who was mounted was spurring toward the thin streak of flame that rose
in the night air half a mile ahead, while the  <i>milice</i>
followed on foot as fast as they were able.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pray God, no more horrors are being perpetrated,&quot; Buscarlet
muttered as he rode by Martin's side down the dusty road. Then murmured: &quot;God
forgive them. God forgive them. They are mad.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>He</i> may forgive them,&quot; said Baville, who had caught his
words, and paraphrasing unconsciously as he spoke the words of one by whose side
he would have been accounted obscure and humble. &quot;He may. I never will. Oh, that
Julien arrives ere long! Then--then--then--they shall know what it is to outrage
Languedoc thus.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The flames grew more furious as all neared the tower whence
they issued. It was the tower of the church at Frugéres; behind those flames
rose the thick white smoke from the burning material below. Also great pieces of
the copings were falling from the summit, and sometimes a pinnacle or gargoyle
fell too. And once as they drew near there came a smothered clang, followed a
moment later by a deep sonorous clash, and those approaching rapidly knew that
the great bell had fallen from its beam, probably by now burned through, and had
been hurled far down below.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon the air as this happened there rose a psalm, a hymn of
praise, telling how the false priests of Baal had been consumed by the flames of
God's wrath in ages long since past, also the shouts and cries of many voices.
Yet none of those shouts were derisive, none scornful or contemptuous. Instead,
the shouts and cries of avengers who testified to justice being done on sinners;
who approved of the justice, yet saw no reason for adding rejoicing to that
approval.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;See,&quot; cried Baville, &quot;they are there. Behold! They move below
the tower. We have them. De Peyre, give the order to charge. At them, among
them, spare none.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The belief in witchcraft was not yet dead in the world. People
still believed in sorcery and enchantment. What wonder, then, that the dragoons
thought there was some necromancy in the fact that, as they tore down the dusty
road, their blades gleaming in the light cast by the flames, all against whom
they rode vanished suddenly? Were there one moment, gone the next. It seemed
incredible. Half a hundred men had been before them when they were five minutes'
distance off; now that they had reached the burning church, not a living soul
was to be seen. Truly it savoured of the miraculous. Yet, ere many months had
passed--indeed, but a few weeks--these soldiers, and others too who were soon to
join them, learned that no foe against whom they had ever been opposed possessed
so thoroughly the art of sudden disappearance as did these fanatics, known later
as the Camisards. For, trained in their mountain homes to every physical
feat--to leaping great chasms, climbing dizzy heights unaided by aught but their
strong and agile feet and hands, descending giddy precipices as easily as their
own goats--they could disappear, disperse, as quickly and as thoroughly as the
snow wreath under the spring sun. Could lure on bodies of their enemies to
sports fraught with danger to all but themselves, into quagmires and morasses,
lonely mountain passes and fatal hilltops, then themselves vanish and be no more
seen.</p>

<p class="normal">It was so now upon this second night of their uprising.</p>

<p class="normal">As the dragoons charged down upon the paved, open  <i>place</i>
outside the church of Frugéres they charged upon empty space alone, encountered
nothing that offered resistance either to their onrush or their gleaming blades.
Nothing but the dead body of a man, a priest, lying on those stones beneath the
tower, the head broken in, the limbs twisted and contorted.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Grand Dieu!</i> what are we dealing with?&quot; exclaimed the
Lieutenant General, wiping the sweat from his face as his men pulled up around
him, while some rushed into the church on foot, their long swords in their
hands, ready to be thrust through any breast that they encountered, and others
to the presbytery, thinking the  <i>attroupés</i>
might be hiding there. &quot;With human beings or devils?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay,&quot; said Baville, &quot;with the children of the desert and the
mountains. Yet also the children of the devil. They escape but for a time,
however. Even these jugglers can not disappear when they are surrounded. And,&quot;
he added, striking one white-gloved hand into the palm of another, &quot;they shall
be surrounded by such a fast-closing circle that ere long not one shall escape.
I swear it here before this murdered man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Easy to swear such an oath. More difficult to keep it. As, at
last, Baville found.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who is he?&quot; Martin asked. Then added in a whisper to
Buscarlet: &quot;This is murder, not justice. Cruelty, not retribution. See, he is an
old man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are right, sir,&quot; Baville replied, whose ears nothing ever
escaped. &quot;Yet be sure their time will come.&quot; Then, looking down at the dead
priest, he also asked, &quot;Who is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the reverend curé,&quot; one of the dragoons said, regarding
the old man and wiping from his face at the same time the beads of perspiration,
even as his leader had done a moment before. &quot;I know him well; am of the next
parish. He has thrown himself from the tower. As well have staid for the flames
as perished thus, broken all to pieces.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">All gazed down also as the man uttered these words, and as
they did so, none speaking, they recognised that they were face to face with an
awakened fury, with a vengeance that had slumbered but which now awoke even as
the baited lion awakes and turns at last to rend its foes.</p>

<p class="normal">For more than sixteen years the  <i>affectés</i>, the New
Religionists, the Heretics, had bowed their heads beneath the yoke of him whom
they called the Scourge of God, as well as of the priests and the De Maintenon,
the woman whom Louvois and La Chaise had once used as an instrument to work on
her lover's intolerance, but who, since she had become that lover's wife, had
herself carried on the system. Born a Protestant, she had seen that the king's
mind became more sunken in superstition as he grew near his end, and that, to
keep that mind under her subjection, the surest way was to persecute those whom
she had deserted and whom she hated. Therefore she revelled in their
suppression, therefore she boasted to her sister bigot, the Princesse des
Ursins, that in twenty years, if Louis' life was spared, there would be no more
Huguenots in France.</p>

<p class="normal">Meanwhile her orders were carried out strenuously wherever
Protestants harboured, especially so in the Midi. &quot;<i>Saccagez ces chiens des
Huguenots, saccagez les, c'est la volonté du roi</i>,&quot; her minister, Louvois,
wrote. &quot;Drive out  <i>ce monstre de l'hérésie, ces chaires de pestilence, ces
synagogues de Satan</i>,&quot; exclaimed the priest. And it was done.</p>

<p class="normal">Swiftly to all the jails in the warm south, to the galleys
waiting at Marseilles for their victims, to the lamp-posts on the town and
village bridges, to the fuel in the market places, to the axe, the wheel and the
rope, the Protestants were hurried.</p>

<p class="normal">Also the dragonnades began. The dragoons,  <i>les cravats</i>,
were quartered in houses, sometimes in Protestant churches. Wives and daughters
were so treated that, to hide the bitterness of their shame and to escape the
horror of ever meeting their father's or brother's glances again, they took
their own lives. They need not have feared those glances, for, the jails being
soon full to overflowing, hundreds of male Protestants were huddled off in crazy
brigs and tartans and snows to the Mississippi and New France generally, where,
if they were not drowned on the way, they mostly perished from the effects of
the climate or by the hands of the Natchez.</p>

<p class="normal">For sixteen years it had gone on. By the end of that time the
Protestant churches were all closed and the Protestant ministers forbidden to
perform their services under pain of death; scores, indeed, had been executed
for doing to, while still scores more, at the risk of death, performed those
services and held Divine worship in the mountains and woods. Also none were
allowed to quit the land who could be prevented from doing so, though a hundred
thousand did manage to escape to other countries, high-born women and girls
being disguised in most cases as muleteer's boys; high-born men of the oldest
blood in France--such men as Ruvigny and Duquesne--driving pigs and asses toward
the frontier, or disguised as pilgrim monks, or pushing handcarts full of fruit
and vegetables or Nîmes serges, which they pretended they were desirous of
selling. But these were people of wealth, people who left behind them in their
flight the châteaux in which countless generations of their race had been born,
left also their rich furniture and equipages and costly plate and silks and
satins, and the woods and forests and vineyards to which they had been born the
heirs and to the enjoyment of which they had looked forward for the rest of
their lives. Or they were skilled mechanics and artisans who could gain a
livelihood wherever they found themselves. But for the poorer sort there was no
flight possible; if they left France they must die of hunger in other lands.
They had no money, could speak no tongue but their own, often knew no trade by
which they could earn their bread; understood nothing beyond the breeding of
cattle and the arts of husbandry. Yet they, too, fled from persecution, though
in a different manner. High up in the gloomy and, to strangers, inaccessible
plateaux of the Cévennes--a region of sterile mountains on which for six months
in the year the snow sometimes falls unceasingly, while for the other six the
heat is almost the heat of the tropics--they sought a refuge. Here in this
mountainous region, which covers an extent of one hundred and twenty miles, they
found a home, here worshipped God in their own fashion and unmolested, which was
all they asked, yet saw with horror, when disguised they ventured down into the
plains, the misery that was still overwhelming those of their own faith. Also
they knew that plans were being formed for their extermination; that from Paris
was coming an army under Julien, a bloodthirsty soldier who had once been a
Protestant like themselves, but who was now a convert possessing all the
tigerish fury of the convert against those whom he had deserted; knew that Du
Chaila was the most brutal of all priests as Baville was the most cruel of all
rulers. No wonder that they groaned over the ferocities inflicted on any of
their number who were caught below in the plains. The capture of the girl
Fleurette and of the guide Masip ignited the flame of revenge which had long
been smouldering. But even then, when they descended to Montvert, it was more
with the desire of rescuing the victims than aught else. In their hearts there
had been at first no intention of murdering either the abbé or the curé of
Frugéres. Moreover, it was not against Louis that they rebelled but against his
Church and the priests of that Church.</p>

<p class="normal">But Du Chaila had caused the dragoons to fire on them, and the
first shot from the soldiers' musketoons had roused their passion; also it
brought about a conflict of horrible cruelty and bloodshed which the passage of
years alone extinguished. For now that war of retaliation had commenced which
two of Louis' field marshals were successively unable to quench, and which a
third only succeeded in doing, more by diplomacy and tolerance than by steel or
ball.</p>
<br>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;What has he on his breast?&quot; asked Baville, leaning over the
dead priest and pointing to something white that gleamed in the light cast by
the flames from the burning church.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A scrap of paper, Monsieur l'Intendant,&quot; the dragoon who had
taken the most prominent part among his fellows replied, &quot;with writing upon it.
It is pinned to his vest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Give it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he read aloud, not heeding, apparently, whether either
Buscarlet or Martin heard the words:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This paper replaces another containing the names of a score
of men to be denounced to the monster, Baville. The man has gone before his God.
Baville will follow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will he?&quot; the Intendant said to himself in a low, clear
voice, which all heard. &quot;Will he? Doubtless some day, but not now. For a surety
not before these wolves have been tracked to their caves and exterminated--as
they shall be--as they shall be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And all watching him in the lurid light cast from the burning
tower, saw that the white-gloved hands were opened and clenched again twice, as
though he had the throats of those wolves he spoke of within them.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_11" href="#div1Ref_11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;CONSORTING WITH HERETICS.&quot;</h5>

<p class="normal">It was midnight when all rode into Alais, and the iron shoes
of the horses clattering on the cobble-stones of the street woke from their beds
the few who were asleep.</p>

<p class="normal">There were, indeed, not many who slept that night at this
hour, since all knew that the fanatics, as they were invariably termed by those
of the vicinity who were not of the Protestant religion, had descended from the
mountains upon Montvert and had slain the abbé. Also all knew that, two hours
before sunset, the dreaded Baville had gone forth escorted by de Peyre and his
cavalry as well as by the  <i>milice</i> of the province--gone forth to inflict
a terrible vengeance on the murderers. Had they done so? they asked each other
feverishly now as the dragoons rode in, the rattle of hoofs and scabbards and
bridle chains deadening the whispers they addressed to each other. Had they done
so?</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps it was not strange that here, in this little town
nestling in its rich valleys, the slopes of whose hills were covered with
cornfields and vineyards and chestnut woods, the beauty of which was so extreme
that in the language of the Cévenoles it was termed the
<i>Hort Dieu</i>, or, in purer French,  <i>Le Jardin de Dieu</i>, all should
have whispered their imaginings, since it was in Alais particularly that
religious opinion was much divided, the Reformed faith numbering nearly as many
adherents as the Romish. Whispered their imaginings because each feared the
hostile ears to which their uttered thoughts and ideas might penetrate, none
knowing as yet which side was to prevail in the great struggle. For if Baville
had destroyed the Camisards, retribution would be swift and strong on all who
were Huguenots; if, on the contrary, he had failed, those of the older faith
might expect to find themselves victims of an awful retaliation before another
night had come.</p>

<p class="normal">At first none could discover aught. The dragoons with their
leaders and the two men--one old, the other young, who seemed like
prisoners--swept onward to the Hôtel de Ville. Soon the streets became quiet
again and all within the houses sought their beds, though, perhaps, with not
much hope of obtaining any rest.</p>

<p class="normal">If, however, they did so hope, they were doomed to
disappointment.</p>

<p class="normal">For scarce had the clatter of the men led by de Peyre died on
their ears, scarce had the horses' hoofs ceased to ring down the streets, than
another hubbub arose. More trampling of cavalry and the ringing of iron shoes
upon the cobble-paved road was heard, more jangling of accoutrements and more
shouts and calls; also the blare of trumpets and the deep, heavy roll of
artillery over the stony streets. Whereon many who had but just laid down upon
their beds sprang up again and, huddling on their garments, ran to their windows
and doors, the Protestants asking if this were some fresh force arriving to add
to their persecutions, the Catholics wondering if the fanatics had descended
from the mountains again and were besieging the town? Yet soon the latter were
assured that such could not be the case, while, to counterbalance the other's
feeling of safety, the Protestants trembled more and more, not knowing what
fresh horrors were preparing for them, for all saw at a glance these were no
mountaineers clad in their white sheepskins, nor Camisards, but, instead,
regular troops well equipped and armed and uniformed. Also all knew that the
<i>attroupés</i> had no artillery or horses. With different feelings, each
watched, therefore, this new arrival of soldiers and saw go by the fierce
dragoons of Joyeuse, the fusileers of Montluçon, the regiments of Saultz and
Bearne, and one of light-horse from the far north--the chevaux-légers of
Bapaume; saw, too, the artillery organized by St.-Hilaire, now dead.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God help us!&quot; the Protestants said, trembling behind their
blinds, &quot;God help us! was this needed too?&quot; while one old man, crouching behind
the fountain in the market place, whispered to another, &quot;Those great guns! those
great guns! See! Are they to blow our houses down above our heads?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tush!&quot; exclaimed a tall man standing by their side, a fellow
bronzed and black from the winds of many wintry storms as well as from the
scorching rays of the southern sun. &quot;Tush! they are for the children of God, up
there,&quot; and he turned a dark gleaming eye toward the dusky summits above the
little town, over which by now there was stealing a cold gray that told of the
coming of the summer morning. &quot;Fear not for yourself, or them up there.
Baville's roads are not yet made and never will be. Let us see that artillery
mount into the Cévennes,&quot; and he laughed scornfully, some might have deemed
cruelly.</p>

<p class="normal">Shrinking away from his great form, half in fear, half with
dawning intelligence, the old man said: &quot;You speak thus, as though you were of
the persecuted--yet--yet--you wear the garments of--of--the valleys, the clothes
of townsmen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But the swarthy stranger only muttered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Peace, old man, and be silent. Has not the quarry worn the
garb of the hunter before now?&quot; Then he moved away and was lost in the crowd
which had gathered afresh.</p>

<p class="normal">Ahead of all--of artillery, dragoons, chevaux-légers--there
rode one who, but for the richness of his apparel his scarlet coat glistening
with stars and traversed by a great ribbon, his hat laced and cockaded with
galloon until none of the felt was visible, his gold-hilted and long quilloned
sword, might, judging from his fierce looks, himself have been a refugee of the
mountain plateaux and deserts above. A man with a great face in which were set
fierce rolling eyes, a man from whose heavily moustached mouth there issued
oaths whenever he opened it.</p>

<p class="normal">This was Julien, one of Louis' field marshals, who, because of
his having left the Protestant faith to embrace that of the king, was spoken of
in all the lands where the Protestants sheltered themselves as &quot;Julien the
Apostate.&quot; Also he was spoken of by them with hatred and loathing since once no
better soldier of Protestantism had ever existed or, under William of Orange,
had done better service. But William, the great champion of Protestantism, was
dead now, and Julien, whose love for wealth was unquenchable, had learned that
Roman Catholicism was the most paying game. Thus it was that he came this night
into his own part of the country, since he was of old family in the town of
Orange itself, to lay waste and to slaughter all who held the faith which he
himself had once held. He was a true pervert!</p>

<p class="normal">With an oath he turned to the aide-de-camp who rode behind him
and asked where this accursed Baville was, bidding him ride forward at once and
see what preparations had been made for the reception of his forces. Bade him
also ask if every Protestant house had been put under orders to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;they must pay for their contumacy  <i>
fasse Dieu!</i> We should have good feeding here. The vagabonds are rich in all
good things in this town. We must have our share.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">The next day dawned bright and fair with still no speck in the
blue sky toward which the great mountains lifted their heads, and with the
bright sun over all--over vineyards full of their ripening grapes, over meadows
in which the cattle stood under the shadows of the chestnut trees that dotted
them at intervals--lighting up, too, the cool dark woods that clothed the
slopes. Also it peered into old and dusty houses, shining in on the ancient
furniture and vessels that generation after generation had prized and polished
regularly and been proud of.</p>

<p class="normal">It shone, too, into another spot--the principal chamber of the
Hôtel de Ville, where on this bright July morning were assembled all the
representatives of law and order in the province, Baville at their head.</p>

<p class="normal">He was seated now in the presidential chair of this apartment,
which served as the debating room for all things connected with the municipal
affairs of the town; on either side of him sat his colleagues, the field marshal
being on his left hand, the bishop of the diocese, which was a newly created
one, on his right. Also the mayor was there and de Peyre, several Catholic
priests, and half a dozen monks of various orders who had followed in Julien's
train, they being sent down by the De Maintenon because of their gifts of
preaching. For, true to her colours, the unproclaimed queen pretended on all
occasions that the cruelties which were practised in the south were repugnant to
her, and that it was by listening to the word of God alone, as expounded by
eminent churchmen chosen by herself, that she trusted to witness the conversion
of the heretics. Yet, if all written records on the subject are true, it was she
who had first spurred on Louvois to give the order to &quot;<i>saccagez les
hérétiques</i>,&quot; and had, after his death, persuaded Chamillart, Bossuet, and Le
Dieudonné himself to continue the Holy Crusade in the same manner.</p>

<p class="normal">Whether it was because Baville meant upon this occasion that
there should be no doubt in Julien's mind as to who was the absolute chief here
and representative of the king, the field marshal having already on their
meeting overnight uttered some very decided opinions upon what steps should at
once be taken in Languedoc for the stamping out of heresy, or whether it was
from his determination to make an altogether splendid figure among the
ecclesiastics and handsomely apparelled officers, he himself presented a
dazzling appearance on the occasion. His costume was now entirely of white
satin, the gold lilies being stamped upon it at various intervals and in
squares; his hat, which he wore upon his head as the king's Intendant, was also
white and fringed with gold; his sword was gold-handled and sheathed. Also his
satin gloves were tasselled with gold thread, while, above all, he wore the  <i>
justaucorps à brevet</i>, or nobles' close coat. Upon his face--a handsome one,
showing no traces of the fierce determination of his character--there sat this
morning an easy look such as he might have worn had he been assisting at the  <i>
fiançailles</i> of some grand siegneur of Languedoc, instead of at a council of
war, bloodshed, and extermination. He had long since learned that not only the
face, but also the whole deportment of a diplomatist should be a mask and not a
glass in which men could read.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here,&quot; he said, taking up a paper as he spoke, and glancing
his eye around upon all who sat near him, &quot;is a report of what has been done of
late by these  <i>attroupés</i> from the hills, dating from their first
murmurings. It is best I recite them. You,&quot; and he looked at Julien, &quot;will then
know against what you have to contend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Splendeur de Dieu!</i>&quot; the great swashbuckler exclaimed,
using one of his most magnificent oaths, &quot;let me but get at them and will make
them sing something else than their accursed Calvinistic canticles, I warrant
you. Read, your Excellency, read.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The fringed glove of his Excellency flattened out the paper,
the gloved finger was placed upon a line, and Baville began.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Three months ago Adolphe Canivet was hung upon the bridge at
Florac. His crime was, that he, a heretic, has blasphemed the king, also Madame
De Maintenon.&quot; Baville raised his hat as he mentioned these august personages.
Then, having replaced it, he continued: &quot;Four nights afterward, Canivet's body
was removed from the lamp; the next morning in its place was found the body of a
dog, hung by the neck. Around that dog's neck was a label, and on it written,
'Thus will the dog Baville hang.' You laugh, monseigneur,&quot; the Intendant said,
glancing at Julien and looking, for him, a little ruffled. &quot;You forget, perhaps,
that the 'dog Baville' represents the king here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I forget nothing,&quot; said Julien, &quot;neither do I laugh. Go on.
Later, I promise you, I will even remember the dog.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;From that time the so-called Protestants braved us in every
way,&quot; Baville continued. &quot;In spite of all our care, they have left the country
in great numbers, some getting across to Savoy, some escaping by the sea, many
fleeing into the mountains. Also they refuse to enter the churches to hear Mass,
preferring to hold meetings in the mountains and woods.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At this the bishop groaned, but Baville, pretending not to
hear him, went on:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Many have descended from the mountains at night and demanded
alms and ammunition, having none themselves, from those who possessed them. The
prior of St. Gervais had his house broken into and several musketoons taken,
they having been left in his charge by some of De Broglie's soldiers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Malédiction!</i>&quot; exclaimed Julien, &quot;why left they their
arms with a priest?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They were scaling the mountains to find the outcasts,&quot;
Baville answered. &quot;Being good soldiers,&quot; and he looked severely at the other as
he spoke, &quot;they depended on their swords and pistols.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Humph!&quot; muttered the marshal, &quot;a soldier who parts with his
weapons is a fool. He who leaves them with a priest is a double fool.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Treachery, too, is rife,&quot; the Intendant continued, still with
his finger on the paper. &quot;Some of these heretics who have refused conversion,
yet were willing to swear fidelity to the king, were put on guard on the town
walls here in Alais. Also at Nîmes and Anduse. In the morning their muskets were
empty. They had not been fired, consequently the charges had been drawn.
Needless to suggest where those charges went.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Also,&quot; put in the bishop, &quot;many murders have been committed.
Du Chaila and the curé of Frugéres within the last two days. What next? What
next?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Du Chaila,&quot; exclaimed Baville, &quot;was my right hand. He feared
naught, punished with justice, though with severity; would have assisted me to
stamp out these rebels, I do believe, had he lived. Now he has been brutally
murdered. Both he and the curé must be avenged.&quot; After which he proceeded to
tell the whole story of the abbé's murder; from the beginning as it had been
told to him; at the end, as he himself knew it. And he told them, too, how he
had brought back with him to Alais the only person left in the village of
Montvert when he reached it with de Peyre and the marquis.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At present,&quot; he went on, &quot;I know not what to do with them.
One is Buscarlet, who was the Protestant curé, but who has been suspended from
his heretical worship for some years and has lived upon some small means he has,
supplemented by gifts from those of his crew who are well to do. He is of the
best among them, at least openly. Preaches submission openly to law and the
Government; what he may do in secret I know not. But, unlike so many of his
brethren, he has never fled. The other is a stranger to these parts and a
gentleman. A proprietor in the north. Speaks too, I think, truthfully. If it
pleases you they can be examined.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would be best,&quot; the bishop said.</p>

<p class="normal">Baville made a sign to the  <i>greffier</i> of the court who
advanced toward him; then, after giving the man his instructions, he turned to
the bishop and said: &quot;Monsiegneur, they have been sent for. In a moment they
will be before you. They are close at hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They were so close at hand that they entered the court almost
at once, escorted by the  <i>greffier</i>, the pastor walking by the side of
Martin and both returning the salutation of Baville, who, true to the outward
bearing to which he had trained himself, bowed with civility. In his heart he
had long since determined that Buscarlet was one of the most dangerous of the
Protestant ministers with whom he would have to deal, for the simple reason that
it was impossible to find any flaw in his conduct which would justify him in
transporting him to the galleys or New France; and therefore, until that flaw
was discovered, until the opening was given him, he did not betray his
determination by outward rudeness.</p>

<p class="normal">As for the stranger who was before him, he scarcely knew what
his course of action should be. The story he told of himself might be true, in
which case he had no possible authority for molesting him, while, even though it
were false, he would have great difficulty in proving it to be so.</p>

<p class="normal">Also, as happens frequently to those of the most astute minds,
he had forgotten to put one leading question to this stranger: To ask him if
he--who had been the lodger of this pestilential heretic, and who, by a strange
chain of circumstances, was the only other witness of the abbé's murder who had
remained behind in Montvert--was himself a heretic.</p>

<p class="normal">Had forgotten it; though now it seemed to Martin, as he stood
there looking round the room filled with men all bitterly hostile to the
Protestant faith, that the question could no longer remain unasked. Would that
bishop, sitting there calm and impassive, also omit to ask it? That field
marshal omit it too, whose apostasy and fierce vindictive hatred of those he had
deserted was known and talked of wherever half a dozen of the Reformed faith
gathered together to discuss their persecutions and their persecutors? Also
those priests and those six hooded monks who had followed in the soldiers'
train? Scarcely could he deem it possible!</p>

<p class="normal">Well, he was prepared with his answer. No denial would issue
from his lips, no lie be told. Therefore he took the place to which the
Intendant motioned him, and, sitting, down by Buscarlet's side, prepared calmly
to await whatever might happen.</p>

<p class="normal">Had he been able to see behind him he would have observed that
which, even though it had carried him no consternation, must have astonished
him; for on the face of one of those cowled monks, the man even throwing back
the hood from off his forehead to stare more intently at him as he endeavoured
to catch a second glance of Martin's features, he would have noticed a look of
profound astonishment--the look of one who sees another in the last place of all
where he would have expected so to see him, and who, while thus seeing, can
scarcely force himself to believe his own eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur Buscarlet,&quot; said Baville, quietly and with no accent
either of impoliteness or reproof in his tones, &quot;what happened at Montvert the
other night amid some who were once your flock must be clearly told to all
assembled here. From you I must demand an account, as I have the right to do.
Later I shall ask this gentleman, Monsieur Martin, if he agrees with that
account.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he said the words &quot;Monsieur Martin&quot; the  <i>cordelier</i>
started. Then over his shaven face--a face unrelieved by either eyebrows or
eyelashes, so that those who looked at him might doubt if indeed his cheeks were
ever touched by razor and if their lack of hair was not due to a defect in
Nature--there came that look of new-born recognition which all have seen spring
into the countenances of others.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Martin!&quot; he uttered, &quot;Martin! Ay, that was the name. The name
he was called by. It is he. What does he here? He of the house of de Rochebazon,
and consorting with heretics!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_12" href="#div1Ref_12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;I AM A PROTESTANT.&quot;</h5>

<p class="normal">An hour later the meeting in the Hôtel de Ville had broken up,
yet not before Buscarlet had said words such as he had better have bitten out
his tongue than have uttered; for, after he had told his tale truthfully (as
nothing would have prevented him from telling it) and had described all that had
taken place from the moment when, singing their psalms, the men of the mountains
had passed down the village street, bidding all the inhabitants keep within
doors--narrating, too, how he had besought them to spare the abbé and return
good for evil--the Intendant had remarked almost angrily to him:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet, in spite of all you say, the rebellion against the
king's authority, the murder, and all other violence has happened, as it always
happens, in a place of strong heretical leanings. Oh, you Protestants, as you
term yourselves; oh, you of the Reformed faith, as you blasphemously name
yourselves--ever are you at the root of all rebellion, of all eruption, all
attacks upon those who are God's anointed. Yet you can never triumph.
Never--here in France.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke he revealed to those around him what were his true
feelings in regard to all that had taken place, though indeed some of them knew
or suspected those feelings; revealed that it was the resistance to the king's
power, the constituted authority, which he was determined to crush more than the
resistance to the ancient and, in this place at least, cruel faith of the land.
These were indeed his feelings, this his guiding motive. He was above all things
a courtier, a king's man; and though for thirty-three years he never quitted
Languedoc for a single day, he becoming its Intendant in 1685 and retiring from
it in 1718, Versailles with its powerful master was the star on which his eyes
were ever fixed. Nay, he himself had said that
<i>Le roi était son Dieu</i>, and that to do him service was all he lived for.
As for the outraged Romish faith, let Rome repay that outrage. His duty was to
crush rebellion, and he did it well. When he finally left the province, he had
caused twelve thousand Protestants to suffer either death, imprisonment, or
transportation to the galleys.</p>

<p class="normal">But now from Buscarlet there came a denial of Baville's
charges against his creed. Rising from his seat by Martin's side he spoke, while
all in the room gazed in astonishment at the old man, never expecting to hear
the words he uttered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your Excellency,&quot; he said, &quot;have you weighed well your words
ere you uttered them? Scarcely, I think. All rebellion comes from us, the
Protestants, you have said, all attack upon those who are God's anointed. Is
this so? Pause, sir, and reflect. Who was it who first uttered the maxim that
bad kings should be deposed? Who were those whom Henri of Valois saw force their
way into his palace of the Louvre, carry off his furniture, reverse his arms,
destroy his portrait, break his great seal, style him  <i>Lâche</i>,  <i>
Hérétique</i>,
<i>Tyran?</i> Was it not the Sorbonne who declared the people absolved from
their vow to him, erased his name from the prayers of the Romish Church? Who
slew him at St. Cloud? Jacques Clement, the monk--was he a Protestant?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Henri de Valois was himself a murderer,&quot; the bishop made
answer. &quot;Himself slew the Guises at Blois.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How many Protestants have been murdered by orders of our
present king? Yet there is not one in France who would raise his hand against
him,&quot; the pastor continued. Then, as though carried away by one of those
ecstasies which caused men, especially men among the refugees of the mountains,
to seem almost inspired, he continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your Excellency has said we attack those who are God's
anointed. Do we so? Who formed the rebel league to exclude Henry of Navarre from
the succession? Who was it struck that great king to the heart in the Rue de la
Ferronnerie? Ravillac! Was he of the Reformed faith? Who would have turned Louis
off the throne he now sits securely on, have set up the Prince of Condé in his
place? Who? Who? Not Protestants for sure! Name one who has slain a king or
attempted to slay one in all our land.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur Buscarlet,&quot; Baville replied, still containing
himself, &quot;there is no accusation against those of your faith as to their
desiring to slay King Louis. But they have revolted against all constituted
authority, against all who here rule for the king, against his priests. Your
statement as to what misguided men of our own faith have done helps you not. Two
wrongs do not make one right. And because it is by the Protestants that the
sacred soil of France is threatened, the Protestants must go. Nay, more: those
who rebel must pay the penalty.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said Baville, coming in two hours later to another
room in which Martin sat, he and Buscarlet having been requested to leave the
apartment in which the council were, after they had both testified to all that
had happened at Montvert on the night when the abbé was slain, &quot;Monsieur, I have
heard strange news of you. I wonder you did not see fit to tell me with whom I
had the honour of conversing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With whom you had the honour of conversing!&quot; Martin replied,
looking at him in astonishment. &quot;I think, sir, you forget. I told you my name,
also where my property is--in France.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pardon me, you did so tell me.&quot; And, even as he spoke, Martin
observed, to his still further astonishment, that the Intendant's manner had
become one of almost deference, certainly of increased courtesy, though he had
never been in any way impolite to him since they had met at Montvert. &quot;You did
tell me that. What you omitted to inform me of, quite within your perfect right,
doubtless, was that you were of the de Rochebazon family. Sir, permit me to
congratulate you. There is no nobler house in all France, in Europe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your Excellency, I have not the honour to be of the house of
de Rochebazon----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But, instead, a relative of the late Princesse de
Rochebazon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And as he spoke he did not doubt, nay, he felt sure, that he
had given himself into this man's power. If he knew so much of the de
Rochebazons as he seemed to do, he must know that the late princess had been an
Englishwoman. Baville would also be aware, therefore, what his nationality was.
Yet, still strong in the honour which lay deep within his heart; strong, too, in
his determination to profit by no evasion of the truth when the telling of it
was absolutely necessary, he announced his kinsmanship with her, looking
straight into the Intendant's eyes as he did so.</p>

<p class="normal">In an instant he recognised that he stood in no peril at
present. Whatever Baville might know of the family of de Rochebazon, it was
evident he did not know that the princess was not a Frenchwoman.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur,&quot; Baville replied, &quot;it is the same thing. And, sir,
I welcome you to Languedoc, you, a member of a great family which has stood ever
by the throne, the Church. I hope you will make my house--it is at
Montpellier--your resting place while you remain in the Midi. You will be very
welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thank your Excellency, but it is impossible I should
accept. You will remember I told you I have a mission here--one that I can not
put aside even amid the troublous times which have now arisen in the
neighbourhood. I must prosecute my mission to the end.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To find the lost man you spoke of?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To find him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is he a de Rochebazon? If so, he should be very near to a
great inheritance--an inheritance which, the Franciscan tells me (the monk who
recognised you as the gentleman who attended the last moments of Madame la
Princesse), the Church has fallen heir to.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The monk! What monk? Yet--I remember. There were two at her
bedside: one who watched continuously, another who came at the last moment.
Which is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can not say. Yet I will bring you into intercourse with him
if you desire it. He is here to assist in stamping out this accursed
Protestantism, in helping to convert them to the true faith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your Excellency hates bitterly these Protestants.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hate the king's enemies. And all Protestants are such.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As the Intendant uttered these words Martin told himself the
time had come. He must speak now or be henceforth a coward in his own esteem. It
was for nothing that his father had cast off forever his allegiance to James,
had openly acknowledged that henceforth he abjured the religion to which James
belonged. Not for nothing, since by so doing he had stood his trial before Sir
Francis Wytham and Sir Creswell Levinz, narrowly escaping Jeffreys himself. Not
for nothing, since he had been fined and imprisoned, he who had followed the
Stuarts into exile, almost ruined.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet all would be for nothing--his father's tribulations, his
own repudiation of the wealth his aunt had amassed for him--all would be worth
nothing if now he stood here before this man and, hearing the cause reviled for
which both father and son had sacrificed so much, held his peace like a coward.</p>

<p class="normal">The time had come.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your Excellency,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;stigmatizes Protestants
as accursed; also as the king's enemies. Well, as to being accursed I know not;
it may be even as you say. But I do know that I am no enemy of King Louis.
Yet--I am a Protestant.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You!&quot; Baville exclaimed, taking a step back in sheer
astonishment. &quot;You! Yet a kinsman by marriage of the de Rochebazons. It is
impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nevertheless it is true.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Baville shrugged his shoulders, then suddenly turning round on
him, he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your sympathies, then, are with these rebels here. You
approve, perhaps, of what you saw on the bridge at Montvert two nights ago. Are
here, it may be, to foment further troubles.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You mistake. I utterly disapprove of what I saw. Would indeed
have saved the priest had it been in my power. It is not by cruelty that wrongs
are righted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In Heaven's name, then, if these are your sentiments what
makes you a Protestant?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Conviction. As conviction made that de Rochebazon a
Protestant whom I am here to find some traces of, alive or dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They had remained standing face to face with one another since
the Intendant had come into the room; they were face to face still as Martin
told how the missing heir to the de Rochebazon name and wealth had himself
changed his religion, and, being face to face, he saw a strange look, a shade of
startled perplexity, come into the countenance of Baville. Also he noticed that
he paled perceptibly. Then the latter said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;De Rochebazon,  <i>the</i> de Rochebazon, turned a
Protestant! turned Protestant!--<i>c'est incroyable!</i>--and came here to
Languedoc. When--how long ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not know. Possibly forty years ago. Your Excellency,&quot;
and now the clear blue eyes of the young man looked into the equally clear dark
eyes of the ruler of the province, &quot;do you know aught of him? Can you put me in
the way of finding him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I--no. Why do you ask? I came not here till '85.
And--and--alas! that it should be so. It is their own doing. The Protestants and
I have been at enmity ever since. They have made my rule a bitter one. It is
their own doing, I repeat. Their own fault.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They have not risen until now. Done no overt act!&quot; Martin
exclaimed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Unfortunately, they have done many. You do not know. And they
have resisted the king's ordinances.&quot; Then changing the subject swiftly, he
said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur Martin, you tell me you are here to seek this
missing man; that you have no intention of aiding these rebels. I am glad to
hear it. Yet, remember, if you remain here you do so at dire peril to yourself.
If you take part in any act of rebellion, if you join in any way in their
uprisings, proclaim yourself in the least as an opponent of the law and order
which must be re-established at all costs here, then you too must be responsible
for whatever may befall you. Do you think you can stay here and also remain
neutral?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are there not others in France who, being of my faith, are
doing so? Are there not still De Colignys, De Rohans, De la Trémoilles, De
Sullys in France, surrounding the king's person? Yet they are loyal to him and
he molests them not; accept their service; lets them worship God in their own
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They are not in Languedoc,&quot; Baville said briefly yet very
pertinently. &quot;And the day will come when they will all return to their own
faith. Otherwise France is not for them.<a name="div4Ref_01" href="#div4_01"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Nor will it be for you or yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Martin shrugged his shoulders at the latter part of this
speech, since no answer was possible. France was not for him under any
circumstances when he had once carried out his dead kinswoman's request, had
found and done justice to Cyprien de Beauvilliers or his children, if he had
left any, or, failing to find them, had at last discontinued his search.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Meanwhile,&quot; continued Baville, &quot;I would counsel you to reside
at Montpellier. There, for the present at least, your co-religionists are not
troublesome, and up to now I have not had to exercise the strong hand. Also,&quot;
and now he bowed with the easy grace which had never forsaken him though he had
been absent from Versailles for seventeen years, &quot;if you will permit me, if you
will accept of any courtesy at my hands--at the hands of Baville, the hated
Intendant--I shall be pleased to be of service to you. As a connection of the
house of de Rochebazon I may do that, while as a private gentleman, who does not
obtrude his religious belief upon me, I shall be happy to assist you in your
quest. Though I warn you I do not think you will succeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You think the man I seek for never came here, or, coming, is
dead?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment the other paused ere answering, his handsome face
indicating that he was lost in thought, his clear eyes gazing searchingly into
the eyes of the other. &quot;I do not know. I can not say. It is most probable that
if he ever came he is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Leaving no children?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How can I say? At least--if--if he is dead he must have died
and left no trace or sign. Died without divulging who he was.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then Baville turned to the door as though to go; yet ere he
did so he spoke again, repeating his words:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should counsel you to make Montpellier your resting place.
If aught is to be learned I may help you to learn it there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thank you. Doubtless it would be best. Yet there is one
request I must make to you; it is to--to deal gently with Buscarlet. On my word
of honour as a gentleman, he has had no hand in these recent troubles. He
besought those mountaineers who descended on Montvert to spare the abbé.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is nothing against Monsieur Buscarlet at present which
calls for severity. Yet if he does not change his faith I know not what may be
the end. If these Cévenoles do not desist, or are not stamped out, the
retribution will be terrible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On all?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I fear on all. The Church never forgives. The Church will cry
for vengeance against the Huguenots, and I, the ruler, must hear that cry.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And answer it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And answer it; for their resistance is rebellion, and
rebellion must be crushed. Warn him, therefore, to be on his guard. To preach,
above all, obedience to the king. Otherwise there is no hope. The prisons are
already full of his brethren. Bid him beware, I say. They term Louis the
'Scourge of God,' and they speak truly. He will scourge the land of all who
oppose him. And if not he--then his wife.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_13" href="#div1Ref_13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h4>

<h5>URBAINE.</h5>

<p class="normal">From the Mediterranean the warm, luscious breezes of the south
sweep up to where Montpellier stands ere they pass the city and waft to the
summits of the Cévennes the perfume of the flowers and the odours of the rich
fruits which grow upon the shores of the beauteous sea. And from Montpellier
itself, from the old  <i>Place de Peyrou</i>, may be obtained a view that is
unsurpassed both in its beauty and in its power of recalling to the memory the
loathsome cruelties which, perpetrated in the days of Louis the Great King, have
smirched forever that beauty. Far away, too, where rise the tips of the
mountains of Ventoux on the confines of fair Provence, the Alps begin to
show--those Alps over which the weary feet of escaping Protestants had been
dragged as their owners sought the sanctuary of a more free land. Below lies a
beautiful valley watered on one side by the Loire and on another by the Rhône,
watered once also by the blood and the tears of the heartbroken dwellers
therein. A valley teeming once again with the fruits of the earth, and with now
all signs erased of the devastation which he, whose statue stands in that  <i>
Place de Peyrou</i>, caused to be spread around; erased from human sight, but
not from human recollection.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon the other side lies Cette, of scant importance in these
times as seacoast towns and harbours are reckoned, and dead and done with--lies
there basking and smiling beneath the warm sun that shines alike in winter as in
summer. Cette, the place which, in the minds of the forefathers of those who now
dwell there, bore the blackest, most hated name of all the villages bordering
the blue sea. For here the galleys harboured, here fathers and husbands,
brothers and sons, were flung to horrors and miseries and the life of an earthly
hell--a hell whose pangs knew no assuagement till death, most welcome, brought
release.</p>

<p class="normal">From where Baville sat in his open window Cette could be seen;
the harbour in which half a dozen of those galleys lay waiting for their
victims. On a table before him were papers for the sending of other victims to
the prisons of the surrounding towns; also the sentences of death allotted to
many rebels, death in hideous forms. Some to be hung upon the bridges of their
own town, some to be broken on the wheel, some to be burned in market places,
some to have their forefingers struck off (a form of punishment peculiar to the
neighbourhood and to those who had been captured in the present uprisings), and
afterward to be hanged.</p>

<p class="normal">Also on tables at either side of him were orders to the
colonels of local regiments to place themselves under direction of Julien;
orders to others to provide forage and stabling for so many horses and
accommodation for so many men; orders, too, for provisions and forage to be sent
in to Montpellier and Nîmes for the victualling of the forces quartered there.
And to all and every one of these he had already affixed his signature,
&quot;Baville&quot;--a signature which here carried as much authority as if, instead, it
had been &quot;Louis.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet it was not about these papers that Nicholas de Lamoignon
de Baville, Comte de Launai-Courson, Seigneur de Bris, Vaugrigneuse, Chavagne,
Lamothe-Chaudemier, Beuxes and other places, as well as Conseiller d'Etat,
Intendant de Justice, polices et finances--to give him his full names and
titles--was thinking on this bright morning, nor on them that his eyes rested.
Instead, upon a far smaller thing--a thing on which one would scarcely have
thought he would have wasted a moment's attention--a little plain cornelian seal
which he was turning over and over in his hands and regarding carefully through
a small magnifying glass.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Strange,&quot; he muttered to himself, &quot;strange if, after all,
after years of meditation and inquiry, I should thus have lit upon the clew!
Strange, strange!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He struck, as thus he mused, upon a little bronze gong that
stood by his side and ready to his hand, and a moment later the door was opened
and a man of about his own age came into the room in answer to the summons; a
man whose plain garb, made of the local Nîmes serge, and wig  <i>à trois
marteaux</i>, proclaimed almost with certainty that he was a clerk or secretary.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Casalis,&quot; the Intendant said, he having put the seal beneath
some papers ere the other entered, &quot;there is in the library a book entitled,  <i>
Devises et blasons de la Noblesse Française</i>, is there not?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is, your Excellency. Prepared a year ago by Monsieur le
Comte----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Precisely. Fetch it, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The man retired, and, after being absent some few moments,
came back, bearing in his hand a large, handsome volume bound in pale brown
morocco, the back and sides covered with fine gold tooling and with Baville's
crest stamped also on each side--a splendid book, if its contents corresponded
with its exterior.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shall I find any particular entry for your Excellency?&quot; the
man asked, pausing with the volume in his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, leave it. I may desire to look into it presently.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Left alone, however, Baville looked into it at once, pausing
at the names under &quot;B&quot; to regard with some complacency his own crest and arms
beautifully reproduced in colours on vellum.</p>

<p class="normal">Then he turned over a vast number of leaves in a mass,
arriving at the letter &quot;T,&quot; and re-turning back to &quot;R,&quot; finding thereby the page
which was headed &quot;De Rochebazon.&quot; And emblazoned in the middle of the vellum in
red, gold, and blue was the coat of arms of that great family; above it was the
crest of the house, on a rock proper a hawk with wings elevated--the motto
&quot;Gare.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So,&quot; said Baville to himself, &quot;he was of noble family, was a
de Rochebazon. Had I looked at this book when the Comte de Paysac sent it to me,
compared it with the seal, I should have known such was the case a year ago. Yet
what use even if I had done so? What use? One can not recall--undo the past.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And Baville--even Baville, the &quot;tiger of Languedoc,&quot; as he had
been termed--sighed.</p>

<p class="normal">He took next the seal from the papers where he had pushed it
and compared it with the Comte de Paysac's book, though even as he did so he
knew there was no need for such comparison; the crest upon it was as familiar to
him as his own. Then he muttered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is pity Monsieur le Comte did not make his work even more
complete. Some information would be useful. As to whom he married, to wit, as to
whom this young man may be, who is related to the late princess. Also as to the
family of the princess--I should know that. I would the count were still alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As thus he mused a shadow fell across the path that wound
before his open window. From behind the orange tubs which formed a grove in
front of that window there stepped out a girl who, seeing him there, smiled and
said, &quot;<i>Bon jour, mon père</i>.&quot; Then came on to the window and, leaning
against the open frame, asked if she might come in, might bring him some flowers
she had plucked to decorate his cabinet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Always, Urbaine,&quot; he said, &quot;always,&quot; and he put out his hand
as though to draw her to him. &quot;Come in, come in.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Had this been a darkened room, a sombre cabinet into which no
ray of sunlight ever stole, instead of being, in truth, a bright, gay apartment,
the presence of the girl whom he addressed as Urbaine would have made it
cheerful, have seemed to bring the needed sunlight to it; for, as she stood
there, her long white dress giving fresh radiance to the room, her fair hair
irradiated by the beams of light that glinted in through the dark-green leaves
of the orange trees, she seemed to cast even more lustre around, making even the
grave, serious face of the Intendant look less severe. In her hands she carried
a mass of roses and ferns on which the dew sparkled, also some large white
lilies.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come, Urbaine,&quot; he said to her, &quot;come, sit on your accustomed
seat. When you are at Versailles you will have no father's knee to sit upon,&quot;
and, caressingly, he drew her toward him, while she, sitting there, arranged the
flowers into bunches.</p>

<p class="normal">As he mentioned Versailles she sighed and turned her eyes on
him, then said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why send me away, father? I do not wish to go. I desire to
stay here by your side. By my mother's, too. Let me remain,&quot; and she bent
forward and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay,&quot; he answered, &quot;nay, Montpellier is no place for you now.
You are best away from it. At present all is not well. Urbaine, these rebels are
stronger than we thought. Julien has been here a month, and what has he done?
Nothing, except sustain defeat. Now we must have more troops from Paris.
Montrevel, they say, will come; yet ere he does so much may happen. Nîmes, even
Montpellier, may fall into their hands. Urbaine, I will not have you here
to--to--fall into their hands also.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Surely they will not hurt women. They say they attack none
but soldiers--and--and priests; that, rough and fierce as they are, no woman has
ever suffered at their hands. We of our side,&quot; and she sighed, &quot;can scarcely say
as much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who has told you this, child? Perhaps your new friend,
Monsieur Martin. Nay, I see by your blush it is so. Urbaine, you must not
believe all he says. Remember, he is a Huguenot too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has never spoken to me on such themes, or, speaking, has
said nothing you could disapprove of. He says this uprising is wicked, unlawful;
is not the way to gain their ends. Also he has told me that the murder of the
Abbé Du Chaila was revolting to him; that he would have saved him had he not
been powerless.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where is he now?&quot; Baville asked, without making any remark on
what she told him as to Martin Ashurst's sentiments. &quot;I have not seen him for
some days.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not know,&quot; the girl said; &quot;neither have I seen him. Yet
he spoke of going to Alais to see his friend the pastor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Urbaine,&quot; Baville said, &quot;you must speak to him before you set
out for Paris. He may listen to words from you which he will not hear from me.
You must warn him to leave Languedoc, to return to the north.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To leave Languedoc! Return to the north!&quot; she repeated. And
it seemed to the sharp eyes of the Intendant as though her colour changed again.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, child, he is in deadly peril here. Can you not
understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Urbaine replied, &quot;no. What has he done?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Actively, he has done nothing. Yet he is a doomed man,
because of his religion. My dear one, ere long the king will be roused to awful
fury by this rebellion; there will not be a  <i>réformé</i> left in France. And
those who are passive will suffer the same as those who take up arms--in the
Midi--here--at least. Even I shall not be able to shield him. Nay, more, how can
I shield one and destroy all the rest?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can there be no peace?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None! Peace! How can there be peace when none will make it?
These Protestant rebels are the aggressors this time. Ask for no peace. It is
war, a war which means extermination. A month ago I should have said
extermination of them alone; now God knows who, which side, is to be
exterminated. Louis is weakened by these attacks from without, from every side;
all over Europe there is a coalition against France. And half her enemies are of
the Reformed faith, as they term it. It is said that the old religion is to be
destroyed, abolished. Yet Louis, France, will not fail without one effort;
dying, we shall drag to destruction numberless foes. Urbaine, if we do not
suppress these Camisards we have an internal foe to deal with as well. Do you
think one Protestant will be spared?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I may not see him again ere I set out for Versailles,&quot; the
girl whispered, terrified at his words.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then he must take his chance. At best he is but a quixotic
fool.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let me remain here; if there is danger let me share it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never!&quot; Baville said. &quot;The nobility are threatened, the
'Intendant' above all. Your place must be in safety. Oh, that your mother would
go too! Yet,&quot; he added reflectively, &quot;her place is by my side.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And mine is not? Do you say that?&quot; And she touched his face
caressingly with her hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your place is where I can best shield you from the least
threat of danger, my loved one; where danger can never come near you.&quot; And
beneath his breath he added the word &quot;again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Speaking thus to the girl upon his knee, a girl scarce better
than a child, seeing she was now but seventeen years old, Baville--of whom the
greatest of French diarists has said that  <i>il en étoit la terreur er
l'horreur de Languedoc</i>--was at his best. For if he loved any creature more
than another on this earth--more than Madame l'Intendante, more even than his
own son--that creature was Urbaine.</p>

<p class="normal">She was not in truth his daughter, was of no blood
relationship to him, yet he cared for her dearly and fondly and the love was
returned. As the history of this girl was known to many in the province, so it
shall be told here.</p>

<p class="normal">Early in his Intendancy, when Baville (already known as an  <i>
esprit fort</i> by the ministers round Louis) had been appointed to this distant
Government, with, to console him, an absolute authority, he had returned one
winter night from a raid that he had been making on a village in the Cévennes
which, to use his own words, &quot;reeked of Calvinism&quot; and was full of persons who
refused to comply with the new orders that were brought into force by the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He was then but newly married to a sister of
Gourville, the colonel of a local regiment of dragoons, and his wife's welcome
to him was somewhat cooled by the announcement which he made to her that an
intimate friend of his had perished in the raid, leaving behind a motherless
child of whom he proposed to constitute himself the guardian.</p>

<p class="normal">Apprised of the fact that Ducaire was the name of the intimate
friend, Madame l'Intendante shrugged her shoulders and contented herself with
saying that it was the first time she had ever heard of him.</p>

<p class="normal">Later, after reflection, she laughed a little, quoted some
words of M. de Voiture as to  <i>les secrets de la comédie</i> which were no
secrets either to actors or audience, and, in the course of the next two or
three days, uttered pointed remarks to the effect that if politics failed at any
future time, doubtless M. l'Intendant might earn a pleasant livelihood as a
weaver of romances and of plots for plays.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>En vérité</i>&quot; she said, with her little laugh, &quot;Jean de
la Fontaine is old, also  <i>Racine; profitez vous de l'occasion, mon ami.
Profitez vous</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, because they were alone in Madame's boudoir, Baville
rose and stood before his wife and, speaking seriously, bade her cease her
badinage forever.</p>

<p class="normal">And after the conversation which ensued, after, also, the
story which Baville told her, Madame did cease her flippancy, and henceforth had
no further qualms of jealousy.</p>

<p class="normal">In truth, as the child grew up, she too came to love it, to
pet it as much as her husband did, to--because she was an honest, tender-hearted
woman who, beneath all her pride for Baville's great position, had still many
feminine qualities in her breast--weep over it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Pauvrette!</i>&quot; she would sometimes whisper to little
Urbaine, long ere the child had come to understanding, &quot;<i>pauvre petite</i>.
Neither mother nor father either. Ah, well! Ah, well! they shall never be
wanting while we live--say, Baville, shall they?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And the Intendant, the man of &quot;horror and terror&quot; to all
around, looking down upon the babe as she slept in her little bed, would answer
before God that they should never be wanting.</p>

<p class="normal">Both kept their word. Urbaine Ducaire grew up, petted,
caressed, beloved, the light of the Intendant's home, the flower, as he told her
sometimes, of his life; a thing far, far more precious to him than the son, who,
instead of being any comfort to them, was revelling in the impurities of Paris.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_14" href="#div1Ref_14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h4>

<h5>THE ATTACK.</h5>

<p class="normal">Between where the mountains of the Cévennes rise in tumultuous
confusion, with, towering above them all, the gigantic Lozère and La Manzerre
whence springs the beauteous Loire; between this vast mountainous region, which
gives to the mind of him who beholds it the idea of a world falling to ruin and
perishing of its own worn-out antiquity, and the Rhône, the road to the north
winds through a fertile valley--a valley where the meadows and the orchards and
the vineyards run down to the river on which the rafts and boats float along
until the stream empties itself into the Mediterranean at last; boats from which
are wafted the perfume of the new-mown hay, or the fruits which they are
conveying. A valley this in which are little houses set in among the pear trees
and the chestnuts, and covered with bird-swarming ivy wherein the southern
oriole builds its nest and rears its young; houses in front of which the fair
roses of Provence grow in great clusters as they have grown there for centuries,
and over which the pigeons whirl in their flight.</p>

<p class="normal">Once, not twenty years before the period of this narrative,
and before a reformed wanton had urged a superstitious king (already then
growing old and shuddering at the phantoms that arose from his evil and unclean
past, as well as from the fear of what his enemies--the whole world!--might
wreak upon him in the shape of human vengeance) to wage what he termed a holy
war, this valley had been one of a thousand in France where peace and
contentment had reigned. Peace and contentment coupled, it is true, with, in
most cases, a simple humble life, yet still a life free from care. An existence
scarce disturbed by aught more serious than some trifling ailments of the
children who ran about barefooted in the long lush grass, or plunged into the
cool stream that watered the land, or by the sound of the passing bell telling
at solemn intervals how one who had lived there all his days was going to his
rest. A life spent in the open air all through the summer time, or by the
blazing chestnut logs when the snows of winter kept all shut up in their
cottages, carding, weaving, combing, earning their living thus as in the golden
prime of July they earned it by gathering fruit, or cutting the corn and
sheaving it, or rearing the cattle.</p>

<p class="normal">Now all was changed, all but the beauty of the land. The
red-roofed houses on whose tiles the topmost boughs of the pear trees rested,
borne down with fruit, were closed; the wicker basket in which the thrushes and
blackbirds had sung so joyously, not deeming their lives captivity, were empty;
so, too, were the stalls where once the kine had lowed and the horses trampled
as daybreak stole over the mountain tops. All were gone now. The old grandam who
had looked after the children; the children themselves; the stalwart fathers;
the dark-eyed, brown-bosomed women whose black tresses hung down their backs and
served as ropes for their babes to tug at.</p>

<p class="normal">Gone--but where?</p>

<p class="normal">Half of the men to the galleys, to toil until their hearts
burst and they died, worn to skeletons by belabourings and thrashings,
starvation and ill usage; the other half to the mountains, there to meditate
upon, and afterward to take, a hideous, black revenge on those who had driven
them from their homes. The old women gone also, some to fester in the prison
cellars of Nîmes, Uzès, Alais, Niort, and Montpellier. The black-haired mothers
to do the same, to groan in the dungeons for water, even though it were but one
drop to cool their tongues; to shriek to God to take their lives, even though
they were sacrificed in the flames of the market place; to pray to their Creator
to let them die and join their slaughtered babes once more; see again the
husbands from whom the gibbet and the wheel had torn them forever in this world.</p>

<p class="normal">Because they were Protestants, Reformés, Huguenots! That was
their crime! The crime that had roused the woman in Paris--<i>la femme célèbre
et fatale</i>--to urge on her husband the devastation of the Garden of France.</p>

<p class="normal">Down this road now, which wound between the base of the
Cévennes and the banks of the rapid Rhône, upon a sunny afternoon in
September--when all the uncut corn (there being no one to gather it) was bending
on its stalks upon which, later, it would rot, past a burned and ruined church,
past, too, a wheel on which a dried, half-mummified body was bound and left to
shrivel--there came a cortége. A cortége consisting first of a troop of dragoons
of the regiment of Hérault, their sabres drawn and flashing in the sun, their
musketoons slung ready at their backs, their glances wary and eager. Ahead of
them rode their captain, a man tall and muscular, burned black almost from
constant exposure to the sun and by taking part in many campaigns from his
youth, commencing in Germany and Austria. This was Poul, a Carcassonnais, who,
since the outbreak of the Cévennes rising, had been distinguished as one of the
most determined opponents of the  <i>attroupés</i>. Also he was a marked man,
doomed to death by them, and he knew it. But over his midnight draughts of
Hermitage he had sworn often that, ere his fate overtook him, many of the  <i>
canaille</i>
should also meet theirs.</p>

<p class="normal">Behind his troop of dragoons, numbering thirty-five men, there
came a travelling carriage, large, roomy, and much ornamented, and drawn by four
horses. In it there sat Urbaine Ducaire on her way to Langogne, the first stage
on the road to Paris. By her side was seated a middle-aged  <i>gouvernante</i>
or companion, whom Baville had told off to accompany her until she reached
Avignon, where she would be safe outside the troubles of Languedoc and where she
was to continue her journey under the protection of the Duchess d'Uzès. Above
the carriage was piled up her valises and portmanteaux; also upon it were three
footmen armed with fusils, all of which were ready to their hands; also a
waiting maid who was always in attendance upon Urbaine. To complete her guard,
behind the great carriage marched a company of the fusileers of Barre and
Pompidon, headed by a mounted officer.</p>

<p class="normal">Passing the broken and mutilated corpse upon the wheel, Poul
pointed to it with his glove and laughed; then, reining back his horse until the
dragoons had gone by, he looked in at the great window and remarked to Urbaine:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mademoiselle perceives the  <i>canaille</i> are not always
triumphant. As it is with that crushed rat there, so it will be with all. Time!
Time! Our vengeance will come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But the girl, after casting one horrified glance at the thing
which was shrivelling in the broiling September sun, had shrunk back affrighted
into the depths of the great travelling carriage and thrown up her hands before
her eyes while the  <i>gouvernante</i>, addressing Poul, said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur le Capitaine, why call our attention to that? It is
no pleasing sight even to a devout Catholic, moreover a bitter one when we
remember the fearful retaliation that has been exacted. Have you forgotten the
Abbé du Chaila, the curé of Frugéres?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Forgotten!&quot; exclaimed the rough Carcassonnais, &quot;forgotten!  <i>
Ventre bleu!</i> I have forgotten nothing. Else why am I here? Beautiful as is
the freight of this carriage,&quot; and he made a rough bow &quot;it needs no Capitaine
Poul to command the dragoons who escort it in safety. Any
<i>porte drapeau</i>, or unfledged lieutenant, could do that. Nay, it is in
hopes that we may meet some of these singing, snivel-nosed Calvinists that I
ride with you to-day. Oh, for the chance!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Send him away,&quot; whispered Urbaine; &quot;he terrifies me. Would
that my father had chosen some other officer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Ere, however, her companion could do as she requested, Poul
had turned his wrist and ridden again to the head of his troops, a fierce look
of eagerness on his face, a gleam in his coal-black eyes. For from ahead of
where the cavalcade had now arrived--a shady part of the road, on one side of
which there rose precipitously some rocks crowned with bushes, while on the
other was a meadow--he heard a sound which told him his wish was very likely to
be granted.</p>

<p class="normal">A sound of singing, of many voices in unison. Voices uttering
words which reached the ears of all, causing the dragoons and fusileers to look
to their arms and the women and footmen to turn white with apprehension.</p>

<p class="normal">A sound of singing that rose and fell upon the soft afternoon
air as though somewhere a conventicle was being held. And these the words they
sung:</p>

<div style="margin-left:10%">
<p style="margin-bottom:0px">Dieu! que Juda connait: Dieu! qu' Israel adore<br>
Salem est ta demeure et Sion ton autel!<br>
Ton bras de nos tyrans a rompu Tare sonore,</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-top:0px">La glaive qui dévore<br>
Et le combat mortel.</p>
</div>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ha!&quot; called out Poul, his dark face now more suffused with
rage than before, &quot;they are near at hand. Swords out,  <i>mes dragons,
avancez--en double ligne de Colonne</i>; here is more garbage for the wheel.  <i>
En avance les fusiliers</i>--the carriage behind.  <i>Tambours battants. En
avant!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And while the women screamed, Urbaine burying her fair head
for a moment on the  <i>gouvernante's</i> shoulder, the dragoons fell into
double line, and the fusileers of Barre and Pompidon, passing swiftly on on
either side of the great carriage formed up behind them, their drums beating
scornfully.</p>

<p class="normal">At first they saw no enemy, scarce expected to see any, since
all knew by now that these mountaineers fought on the system of those dreaded
Indians whom some of this force had already encountered on the shores of the St.
Lawrence and the Mississippi--namely, by sheltering themselves behind every
available tree or rock, or even shrub, from which they fired on their foes with
deadly effect. But they heard them. Heard again the solemn hymn they sang in the
hour of battle, of death, and of vengeance:</p>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:10%">
<p style="margin-bottom:0px">Aux éclairs de ta foudre, à sa fumante trombe Le
c&#339;ur manque an vaillant, le bras échappé au fort Le char d'airain se brise,
et le coursier succombe,</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-top:0px">Et le guerrier qui tombe<br>
S'assoupit dans la mort!</p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="normal">Then a moment later they saw their foes, or some of them.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon the summit of the rock sixty feet above their heads, amid
the stunted trees and bushes that grew thereon, they saw appear a strange crowd.
Men, tall and swarthy, some old, some almost boys, while there was one of the
latter whose fantastic attire--a vest of bleached Holland garnished with silver
buttons,  <i>culottes</i> of chamois leather, gold-gallooned, ivory-hilted
sword, scarlet mantle and black felt hat, with long white ostrich feather--would
better have become one of Luxembourg's dandy cavaliers than an  <i>attroupé</i>
of the mountains. Also three men, venerable-looking, yet fierce and stern, two
having beards that flowed over their chests, all of whom joined in the hymn that
was being sung by a larger body that was ahead of the place where the Royalist
troops were--ahead, yet advancing toward those who had been caught in the snare,
advancing singing and firing. And by the side of these three, who were
Prophets--<i>Inspirés</i>--there stood a girl, black and swarthy, too, a
bracelet on her arm and in her hands a musketoon, which she raised and, aiming
at the carriage below, fired.</p>

<p class="normal">With a shriek the  <i>gouvernante</i> fell back on to the
cushions dead; with another, Urbaine flung her arms about her, moaning, while
now, from all around, the sound of firing was heard, and, pealing high, above
all else, the voice of Poul, howling orders, yelling curses, laughing defiantly.
Yet why he laughed none knew, for already the saddles of the dragoons were being
emptied rapidly; the ground was strewn, too, with the bodies of the fusileers of
Barre and Pompidon, those who still lived being driven back.</p>

<p class="normal">Fear paralyzes sometimes; sometimes also inspires with a
terrible and desperate courage. It was thus with Urbaine Ducaire at this moment.
She screamed and moaned no more, let the poor dead woman's body lie back in the
carriage, put out her hand to the door that was farthest away from the rock on
which the visible portion of the enemy was, and endeavoured to turn the handle.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, ere she did so, she saw a sight that might well have
unnerved her, have struck her dead with horror.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon the rock-side of the vehicle she saw Poul fighting like a
demon possessed, or, better, like a doomed brave man. She saw his sabre dart
through one fanatic's throat, then through another's breast; she heard his
hoarse, triumphant shouts and terrible oaths, also his words of bitter scorn and
hatred of the  <i>canaille</i> as he thrust at them, then nearly fainted at what
she saw next: A lad standing by the side of the girl armed with the musketoon,
while still she fired as fast as she could load it--a lad who adjusted a huge
stone in a sling, and then, watching his opportunity and whirling the latter
round his head, discharged the missile, which crashed with fatal effect full on
Poul's forehead. And as the brave, rough soldier, with a cry of hideous, awful
agony, fell to the earth, the youth, shouting in his rough
<i>patois</i> that the soul of David had descended through countless ages to
enter his body, leaped down the crags of the rock, fell upon the unhappy man,
and, seizing his sword, began to hack his head off.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can bear no more,&quot; Urbaine murmured, &quot;no more! Pray God the
next bullet fired enters my heart! Otherwise I must die of horror.&quot; And she sank
to the bottom of the carriage, her head on the dead woman's knees, sank back and
lay there in a stupor.</p>

<p class="normal">Whereby she knew not that, even as she did so, across the
meadow a man had ridden on a rawboned horse as fast as he could urge it, had
gained the road, and, swiftly dismounting amid the rain of bullets and stones
from above, had wrenched open the carriage door and lifted her out in his arms.
Knew not that in his strength he had tossed her on to the neck of the horse and
quickly remounted, having but one hand to use in doing so, and that, amid a
storm of more bullets, he had carried her off from where the carnage still
raged, while in his ears he heard more than once the cry--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Voilà ton Poul!</i> He is well trussed. Eat him!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_15" href="#div1Ref_15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h4>

<h5>SHELTER AND REFUGE.</h5>

<p class="normal">That night as darkness fell upon the earth, and while, high up
in the heavens, the bonfires burned which the  <i>attroupés</i> lit regularly on
the tops of the Cévennes in the hopes of thereby luring their enemies into their
strongholds and fastnesses, Martin spoke to Urbaine, saying:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mademoiselle, I know not what is to be done. Had the
unfortunate horse not been slain by that last bullet we might have got back to
safety. To Montpellier or, failing that, to Lunel at least. Now it seems
hopeless. You can go no farther and--and I can not leave you alone while I seek
assistance, which, even if I did, I should not obtain. There is no assistance
for--for those who are not on their side.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can not understand you, monsieur,&quot; Urbaine said quietly.
&quot;You are yourself a Protestant, my father told me--nay, did you not so inform me
that morning in our garden at Montpellier--yet you trouble to save me from your
fr----, those of your faith. I am deeply grateful to you, only I do not
comprehend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment his clear eyes rested on her. In the dusk that
was now almost night she saw them plainly. Then he answered very quietly:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it not enough, mademoiselle, that you are a woman? Must I,
because I am a Protestant, have no right to the attributes of a man?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I--I ask your pardon; forgive me. I would not wound you--you
who have saved me. And I thank you. Only, here, in Languedoc, we have learned in
the last few weeks to expect no mercy from the Protestants.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Like all who have turned against injustice and cruelty, they
are now themselves unjust and cruel. One may respect their turning, even their
uprising, yet not their methods.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then for some moments there was silence between them.</p>

<p class="normal">They were seated, on this warm September night--for six weeks
had passed since the murder of the abbé--upon a bank outside a deserted cottage
a league or so from where the ambuscade and slaughter of Poul and the soldiers
under him had taken place. Above them, all around them, in the little garden,
there grew the sweet flowering acacias which are at their best in the valleys
that lie between the Loire and the Rhône; the air was thick with their perfume.
Also the gourds lay golden on the ground, uncut and ripening to decay. The
scarlet beans trailed in rich profusion of colour on their sticks, illuminated,
too, by the fireflies that danced around. And from the distance of a pistol-shot
off there came the murmur of the arrowy river as it dashed down between its
banks to reach the sea.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet all was desolation here, and death. Death typified by the
poor merle that lay forgotten and starved in its wicker cage, left behind when
those who once dwelt here had fled a fortnight ago to the mountains at the
report that De Broglie's  <i>chevaux-légers</i> were devastating the land. They
fled leaving behind them, too, the three-months-old calf, and the fowls, and all
the simple household creatures, having no time to do aught but shift for
themselves and bear away to safety those other harmless living things, the
children.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is to be done I know not,&quot; Martin went on. &quot;At any
moment they may come this way; they know we have escaped so far. Then--then--it
may mean instant death; at best, captivity in the mountains.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For me,&quot; she answered, speaking low, &quot;for me? I am Baville's
adopted child--the child of his dear friend. But for you--you are of their----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then she paused, leaving the last word unsaid as she saw again
his calm, sad eyes fixed on her. Once more she pleaded for pardon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Forgive, forgive me,&quot; she said. &quot;I am vile, ungenerous to
speak thus. Yet we must part at last. They have no charge against you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We part,&quot; he replied, &quot;when you--when both--are safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They knew not why at such a time as this, when action should
have been everything and no moment wasted, in spite of the girl's fatigue and
prostration, silence should fall upon them; why they should sit there as though
courting a fate that might come at any moment, for at any moment, above the hum
of the near river, there might be heard the voices of the revolted Cévenoles.
Beneath the branches of the acacias that o'erhung the dusty white road would
perhaps be seen the unbrowned barrels of their guns or the scythes with which,
since many of them had as yet no weapons, they were armed.</p>

<p class="normal">A silence between these two broken only by the twitter of
birds in the branches, or by a sigh that rose unchecked from the girl's breast
as, in the starlit dark, she turned her eyes on the features of the man by her
side.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; he said at last, rousing himself, &quot;come. It is madness
to remain here. We must move on even though we encounter death by doing so. It
is not likely that all have returned to the mountains after their victory; they
may pass by here at any moment. Can you proceed at all, mademoiselle?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can at least try. Yet to where? To where?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not know the land very well,&quot; he answered, speaking in
the slow, calm voice which had impressed her so much a month ago when the
Intendant had, with strange indifference (as it seemed to both of them),
presented Martin to Urbaine and left them to pass some hours in the orange
garden of the Intendancy, he contenting himself with telling the girl that her
new acquaintance was from the north and was not of their faith. &quot;I do not know
the land very well. Yet is there not a garrison near here? I think so. Called
the--the château of--the fortress of--Servas.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; Urbaine cried, clasping her hands, &quot;the Château de
Servas. Between Alais and Uzès; not far from here. If we could reach that we
should be safe. The commandant is known to my father--to De Broglie. He would
protect us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We must attempt it,&quot; Martin replied. &quot;It is our chance,
mademoiselle,&quot; he exclaimed, breaking off as he heard a gasp from her lips,
&quot;What is it? What! What new terror?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I forgot,&quot; she whispered, her voice unsteady, &quot;I forgot. In
this instance the case is reversed. They are all of my faith--you--you--would be
sacrificed. They are infuriated with these rebels. Alas!&quot; she almost wailed,
&quot;they would not spare you. It is not to be dreamed on. Anywhere but there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay,&quot; he said, &quot;nay. It must in truth be there. And for me
fear not. I have saved the daughter of his Excellency for them. Even though they
know I am this accursed thing in their eyes, a Protestant, they would scarcely
repay me cruelly for that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They must never know it. By silence you are safe. Oh, let us
attempt to reach it. It is but two or, at most, three leagues. I have been there
with my father. He will bless you, worship you for saving me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Three leagues! three leagues!&quot; he repeated, &quot;three leagues!
For me, nothing. Yet for you, a delicate woman!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The very thought, the hope of safety, inspires me. I am
strong again. Come, monsieur, come, I beseech you, for both our sakes. For
yours, for you who have saved me, above all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not so,&quot; he said. &quot;I am a man who has ventured into the
tiger's jaws and must take my chance. I am of poor account.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And now they prepared to set forth to reach this place of
refuge, yet both knew what dangers might well be expected ere they got there, if
ever. For during the time which had elapsed since the Camisards, as at this time
they began to be called, had risen and commenced their resistance by the
slaughter of the Abbé Du Chaila, all Languedoc had been overrun with them and
was in a state of terror. Also the flight of the inhabitants had become entirely
reversed. It was the Catholics and the Catholic priests who were rushing out of
the province as fast as they could go, while from their mountain homes the
revolted Protestants who had taken up arms were pouring down in hundreds.
Already, too, the cities were in a state of siege and the inhabitants fortifying
themselves within the walls. That very night, although neither Martin nor
Urbaine knew of it, the ancient city of Nîmes, the Rome of France, expected to
be besieged, put to sword ere dawn; for by the time that they were hoping to
accomplish their night journey to the Château de Servas the few dragoons who had
escaped the slaughter which had fallen on Poul's detachment, as well as the
fusileers and another band of cavalry and infantry who had been routed close by
while under the command of De Broglie, had ridden pell-mell into Nîmes, their
weapons broken or lost, their heads covered with blood, themselves and their
horses wounded. Rode in the bearers of awful tidings as to how the fanatics were
led by two persons, one a lad of sixteen named Cavalier, the other a man a few
years older named Roland; rode in and told how women fought on their side as the
Amazons of old had fought; how men preached and encouraged them and sang
canticles as they did so; of how they spared none; had beheaded Poul; had
captured Baville's daughter and slain her, if not worse. Described also, with
white quivering lips, how the tocsins were ringing from half a hundred churches
in flames; told of priests flung across their own altars and done to death, of
soldiers mutilated ere slain--all by bands of men who seemed to vanish into the
air the moment after their deeds were accomplished.</p>

<p class="normal">Meantime Baville's daughter and her rescuer were threading
their course through the meadows and pastures that fringed the wayside, because
thus her feet were more eased by the long, cool grass on which now the dews of
night had fallen, or slowly finding a path through chestnut woods. Sometimes,
too--leaving the river behind them and knowing they were going aright since its
distant hum became fainter and fainter, and since, ever before them, yet afar
off, the summits of  <i>La Lozère</i> and  <i>Bouquet</i> stood out more clear
against the heavens--they passed vineyards on which the black grapes hung in
clusters, when, pausing, they moistened their lips with the soft, luscious
fruit. Yet went on and on, resting at intervals, and then forward again, the
girl leaning on the arm of her companion--the arm of the man whose faith she had
been taught to despise and execrate.</p>

<p class="normal">But once they had to stop for another reason than her fatigue,
to pause in a great chestnut wood where the grass which grew at the feet of the
trees was as soft and silky as thistle-down, and where the deer stared at them
with wide-open, startled eyes; to pause because they heard a hundred yards away
the voices of a band of men which passed along the wide road.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is they,&quot; she whispered, trembling. &quot;It is they. Whom do
they seek?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fear not,&quot; he replied, soothing her, while at the same time
he drew her within the decayed trunk of an enormous chestnut tree over whose
head more than one century must have rolled. &quot;They proceed too rapidly along the
road, too swiftly on their way, to be in search of us. More like they go to
midnight murder, the destruction of some harmless village, the pillage of some
helpless town.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Murder! Destruction! you deem it that? You!&quot; she whispered,
her soft, pure eyes glancing up at his.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I deem it that,&quot; he replied gravely, &quot;retaliation though it
be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The band went on, their voices coming back to them on the
still night air, the refrain of one of their hymns borne back also--a hymn still
breathing of revenge blessed by God, of vengeance ordained by him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you are rested again,&quot; he whispered, &quot;we may proceed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Still helping her, assisting her as gently as though he had
been her brother, he led her on until at last they left the shelter of the woods
and stood upon a little knoll of ground, a spot from which they looked across a
plain bordered on the farther side by slopes and hills that, rising one behind
the other, lifted themselves finally to mountains whose ridges and summits stood
out sharply against the starry sky. Yet saw, too, that now the stars grew whiter
and began to pale, that all the heavens were turning to a soft primrose hue,
while, far away to the east, was the warm suffusing of scarlet which told of the
coming day. Afar off, also, observed other crimson streaks over which there hung
dun-coloured palls of smoke that proceeded from burning towns and hamlets.</p>

<p class="normal">Shuddering, Urbaine directed her glance to the latter, then
said, looking toward the north:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There ahead of us is the Château de Servas. You see?&quot; and as
she spoke she pointed to where, above a low purple-crested hill, a white
building hung.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I see,&quot; he answered. &quot;Pray God we reach it. You can still go
on?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must go on,&quot; she replied. &quot;Once there we are safe. The
château is well garrisoned.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even through this plain, vineyards ran along the side of the
road which led to where the fortress stood; therefore they were not so open to
observation as if it had been a flat, uncultivated expanse; and across this they
passed, sheltered by the vines on either side. And now there arose a chance
unhoped for--one which, had it happened earlier in their journey, might have
brought them to the harbour of refuge they sought before the night had gone.
Grazing at the side of the road was an old mule, a creature rough-coated and
long neglected and uncared for, its hide thick and coarse. Perhaps its being so
poor a thing was the reason why it had not been carried off into the mountains
either by those who owned it or by those who would have appropriated it if owned
by their foes. Yet it served now to ease Urbaine from further toil, since
Martin, catching it and placing his coat across its back as a saddle-cloth,
lifted the girl on to it at once. Then instantly they set off again, he walking
by the patient creature's side and directing it.</p>

<p class="normal">An hour later, when now the light had come and when the
mountain tops were all gilded with the rays of the sun, while below on the plain
the coolness of dawn was already receding before the genial warmth of a new day,
they had reached their journey's end and were mounting the slope beneath the
castle. And seeing the two cannon that stood on their cumbersome old carriages
upon the walls, and the men-at-arms who were already regarding them curiously
from those walls, Martin knew that he had saved the girl for a second time.</p>

<p class="normal">Also she knew it well, yet such was her emotion, such her
agitation at recognising that she had escaped an awful fate, that she was
powerless to express herself in words; but not too powerless to testify her
gratitude by her looks and by the touch which she laid upon his hand. A touch
which he understood and answered also by a glance, and by the muttered words,
&quot;Thank God!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later the wicket in the great iron-barred and studded
gate opened, and a soldier came out and stood regarding them; then called down
the slope:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who are you and what do you seek?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shelter and refuge,&quot; Martin answered back, his voice clear
and distinct in the morning air. &quot;This lady is his Excellency's daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His Excellency's daughter!&quot; the man repeated, his whole tone
one of astonishment. &quot;His Excellency's daughter, and travelling thus on such a
sorry beast!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And travelling thus. Fortunate, indeed, to be travelling at
all,&quot; while, as he spoke, he extended his hands and caught Urbaine as she
swerved on the mule's back and fell fainting into his arms.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_16" href="#div1Ref_16">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h4>

<h5>SUCCOUR.</h5>

<p class="normal">Once more the day was drawing to a close. Already across the
plain the sun's rays were slanting horizontally. Soon the sun itself would have
dipped behind the mountains and be gone. Another night was at hand, and Martin,
gazing on the country around from the castle walls on which he stood, thanked
God that it would bring no terrors to the girl whom he had saved, such as the
past one had brought.</p>

<p class="normal">Since they had been received into the castle in the morning by
the commandant, a man who had once fought in countless campaigns but who now
passed his latter years as governor of this place, he had seen nothing of
Urbaine. She had been escorted to a room in the west wing immediately on their
admission, where, after having been given restoratives in the shape of wine and
food, and after being attended to by two or three of the few women in the
place--soldiers' wives--she had begged that she might be allowed to be alone and
thus obtain some rest. In was sorely needed, Martin said, speaking to the old
chatelaine, sorely needed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And can be procured,&quot; the other replied, twisting up his
great moustachios. &quot;<i>Bon Dieu!</i> we have a room here fit for the reception
of a duchess. Madame de Servas--a pretty thing---<i>une femme de la vieille
souche</i> also--loves a soft nest; yet not one perched in an eyrie around which
such storms blow as those that are now devastating Languedoc, the pest seize
them and those who brew them!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is the lady here?&quot; Martin asked, thinking that, if so, she
would be a comfort to the girl until she could escape back to Montpellier under
his care.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Pouf! pouf! pouf!</i>&quot; the old soldier said, &quot;not she
indeed. I tell you the tempest is too rough for her; she fears too much the
vagabonds up there,&quot; whereupon he nodded toward where by now all the mountain
tops of the Cévennes were gleaming in the morning sun. &quot;Thereupon she is fled to
Paris, the paradise of women; to Versailles--Marly. Well, she is safe there from
these men,&quot; and again he nodded toward the mountains. &quot;From other men, ho!
ho!--of the court,  <i>figurez vous</i>--danger may come, drawn by her bright
eyes. However, there is the nest for mademoiselle.  <i>Tant mieux!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But by now, as the evening drew on, those mountains were
suffused by the soft  <i>couleur de rose</i> that, in a near and less troubled
land, was known as the Alpine glow. And Martin, himself refreshed after some
hours' sleep during the day, was leaning over the castle wall looking down into
the valley and the plain all flushed with the burning sunset of the golden
autumn, with, far off and running through the latter, the silver thread that was
the river Gardon hurrying on to join the Rhône. He was thinking now of many
things, even as his eyes took in the beauties of all the fair department that
lay around him--the distant woods whose leaves were scarce yet browned by the
touch of autumn's fingers; the mill house on the Gardon's bank whose wheel was
now still, since its owner had fled, perhaps forever; the gray convent that lay
farther off and had been half destroyed by fire two nights ago; the crumbled
ivy-clad tower a mile away, in which the king's father, Louis &quot;The Just,&quot; had
caused a score of Protestants to be burned alive--was thinking of many things as
he regarded the fair scene. Whether he would ever see his own land once more,
ever escape out of France, ever meet again in future years the pure fair girl
whose life he had saved but a few hours ago--the girl whose faith and
convictions were so bitterly hostile to his own, as every word she spoke, every
thought she allowed utterance to, testified. Also he was wondering if the search
he had undertaken for the lost de Rochebazon--the search he now deemed a
foolish, Quixotic one--could result in aught but failure here in such a
tempest-tossed spot as this.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never,&quot; he muttered to himself, &quot;never shall I find him.
France's empty coffers must swallow up all the wealth that is his, the Church he
renounced must profit by my own renunciation. Find him! How? Where? Hanging to
some gibbet if he has lived till these days, or learn that years ago he perished
on the wheel or at the stake; that his ashes were cast to the winds. I shall
never find him.&quot; Then he turned, hearing a step upon the leads behind him, and
observed the commandant approaching the spot where he stood.</p>

<p class="normal">Already, when the old soldier had been by his side a few
moments before, he had been made acquainted with all that had happened on the
previous day, and of how it was only by God's mercy that Martin had arrived at
the fortunate moment he did.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was,&quot; he said, &quot;on my way to Valence, to which some affairs
led me, where I heard the sound of firing and the shouts of men engaged in
fierce conflict. And I should have stood outside the fray, have taken no part in
it, but that I saw the travelling coach and observed a serving woman screaming
on the top of it; saw a face at the coach window--that of mademoiselle. I could
not refrain from attempting her rescue. She was a helpless, defenceless girl. It
was no place for her among those men fighting like tigers. Also we had met
before at her father's residency.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Ponz! ponz!</i>&quot; said the commandant, &quot;you did well.  <i>
Nonc d'un chien</i>, you did well for yourself and her. Baville will not forget.
She is the apple of his eye, although no blood relation, yet the child of a
loved friend, confided to him in death. Also his own child is a trouble to him.
The Intendant spends all his heart on this girl. They say he worships her
tenderly, fondly, because of her father. Ask Baville for aught you desire when
you return to Montpellier and you will get it. He will repay you as fully as
if--well!--as if, had you injured her, he would have cut you into twenty
thousand atoms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall ask him for nothing. One does not save a woman's life
for a reward.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That I know,&quot; the commandant replied, a little ruffled by the
rebuke. &quot;Yet, having saved her life, as well let Baville show his gratitude. He
is all-powerful here in the province; his interest, too, is great at
Versailles.&quot; Then, changing the subject, the old man said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If we had but enough men you and she should be sent to
Montpellier to-morrow. Yet 'tis impossible. We have but sufficient here to
garrison the place and to rush out and hurry any of those  <i>scélérats</i>
whom we can catch in small bodies. I can not spare any men to form a guard.
Meanwhile the Intendant probably deems her dead by this time. God help all who
fall into his hands after this!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How is it with her to-night?&quot; Martin asked now, thinking that
since the sun was set she must surely by this time have slept off much of her
fatigue.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is refreshed and rested, the woman tells me who has been
placed in attendance on her. Yet, too, she is very sad. She thinks much on her
father's and mother's grief if they knew, as they must, what has befallen her,
which they doubtless deem death. Oh, that I could communicate with Baville! Yet
'tis impossible. I can not spare a man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can spare me,&quot; Martin answered gravely and with a
seriousness that told he meant what he said. &quot;Give me a horse better than the
poor thing on which mademoiselle finished her journey here, and I will go; will
undertake to reach Montpellier.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You?&quot; the commandant exclaimed, his eyes lighting up at the
suggestion. &quot;You? So! 'tis well. Who better than he who saved her to carry the
good news to her father? Yet, yet,&quot; he said in his next breath, his face
falling, &quot;'tis impossible. You would never reach the city. They are everywhere,  <i>
on dit</i> two thousand strong already. And they spare none; above all, they
will not spare the man who saved the Intendant's loved one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I may avoid them. Even if I do not there may still be a
chance of my escape,&quot; Martin added, remembering that he was of the same faith as
these rash unhappy rebels, although not in sympathy with them. Certainly not in
sympathy with their cruelties.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Escape? Yes, you may, even as by God's grace you escaped so
far as to reach here. But such chances come not more than once together--who
throws the ace twice! Moreover, if they know 'twas she who has slid out of their
claws they will be over all the land, 'neath every bush, behind every stone,
like painted snakes. There is no chance. You must remain here till some of
Julien's or De Broglie's troops come to assist. Yet if you could have done it,
have repeated your last night's valour, Baville would have worshipped you.
Still, still you have done well.  <i>Bon Dieu!</i>&quot;--and the old man slapped the
young one on the shoulder--&quot;<i>vous êtes un homme fort</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Looking away toward where now the purple shadows of the
September evening were resting over all the plain, glancing over to where the
white dusty road that followed the course of the Gardon stood out plain and
distinct in the clear pure air, Martin saw that which told him that no further
opportunity for a repetition of last night's valour, as the commandant had
termed it, was like to come to him.</p>

<p class="normal">Already it seemed as if assistance was at hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;See,&quot; he said, &quot;see! Even now the succour you pray for is
near. Behold some of the troops of those whom you name--De Broglie's or
Julien's! Look! the last rays sparkle on gorget and fusil-barrel. Thank God! She
will be restored to her father. Perhaps to-night. To-morrow at latest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was as he said. Along that white dusty road which twined
beside the river there came a body of cavalry, plain enough to be seen even by
the age-worn eyes of the elder man. A troop numbering about thirty soldiers, on
whose rich galloon, sword hilts, and bridle chains the last beams of the
fast-sinking sun sparkled, it lighting up, too, the rich  <i>bleu du roi</i>
worn by some and the gallant scarlet of the others.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Pardie!</i>&quot; exclaimed the commandant, &quot;the slaughter
could not have been as great as you imagined, my friend. Those men have at least
escaped. Observe, the blue are the dragoons of De Broglie, the red are those of
Hérault. Surely they were in the attack of yesterday,&quot; and he turned his eyes on
Martin almost questioningly, as though wondering whether, for his own
self-glorification, he had exaggerated his service to Urbaine.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Tis strange,&quot; the other answered, &quot;strange. None escaped, I
do believe, who were escorting mademoiselle's carriage. There must have been
another party of the king's troops who were set upon, and these have belonged to
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;May be,&quot; the commandant said, willing enough not to believe
that this man (who had at least placed the existence of one of the most precious
women in the province beyond danger) was a braggart. &quot;May be, yet they have done
more than escape, too. See, they bring prisoners. Fanatics. In chains, observe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Looking again, Martin did observe that he spoke truly. Ahead
of the cloud of dust which the horses raised on the chalk-white road he saw a
band of men on foot; could count six of them, all shackled together by the
wrists and shambling along, one or another falling now and again and causing the
cavalry thereby to halt until they were once more on their feet. No doubt
Camisard prisoners.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ha!&quot; exclaimed the old man, leaning on the buttress by his
side, his knotty hands placed above his eyes to shield them from the sun's last
rays, and perhaps, also, to focus the advancing cavalcade, &quot;they turn by the
mill. Therefore they approach to succour us. Good! To-morrow mademoiselle will
rejoin her father.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then they bade the sentry on the walls fire a salute from the
old saker which had stood them since Ru de Servas had held the castle for Henry
of Navarre.</p>

<p class="normal">It was answered by a blast from a trumpet far down in the
valley, after which the two men standing there, watching the oncoming relief,
traced its progress until at last the band were on the slopes beneath the castle
gateway.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are welcome,&quot; the commandant called out to one who rode
ahead of all the others, richly apparelled in the  <i>bleu du roi</i> coat, and
wearing a well-powdered, deep wig  <i>à la brigadier</i> which hid all of his
head except his features beneath the great felt hat that he wore above the
peruke; &quot;welcome in the name of the king for whom I stand here. Are you sent,
monsieur, to increase our garrison or to escort mademoiselle, his Excellency's
daughter, to safety?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mademoiselle, his Excellency's daughter, to safety!&quot; the
young officer exclaimed, repeating the other's words in evident astonishment--an
astonishment equally testified by all at his back. &quot;His Excellency's daughter!
Is she here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is here. Did you not know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not I! or be very sure we would have been here before. Her
safety is indeed precious.&quot; Then at once he commenced an explanation of their
appearance at the château.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur,&quot; he said, &quot;I am the nephew of M. de Broglie, and
with these others have escaped the fate which has fallen on his followers. Also,
by good chance, we have taken these six villainous  <i>attroupés</i>
prisoners. Yet, since they delay our progress to Alais, we have come here to ask
your permission to imprison them in your château. They will be safe with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ha!&quot; laughed the old commandant, &quot;<i>mort de ma vie</i> they
will. Safe! Yes, till they stand with their backs against the wall of the
courtyard and with a platoon of musketeers  <i>en face</i>. Oh, yes, very safe!
Bring them in, monsieur, the gates shall be open; also to yourselves. You must
not proceed to-night ere you have supped and slept----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is impossible,&quot; the nephew of M. de Broglie answered. &quot;It
is impossible; we must journey on to Alais.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I say it is impossible you can do so. What! refuse a bite
and a sup, a bed with a comrade, also the acquaintance of Monsieur l'Intendant's
daughter? Fie! Nay, more, you must turn back at dawn and escort the lady to
Montpellier. Ho! 'twill not be long ere you find yourself brigadier after that
service.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again the young officer protested, again said it was
impossible. They must proceed even though they missed a sight of  <i>les beaux
yeux de mademoiselle</i>. Yet, even as he so protested, the commandant saw signs
of his yielding and urged his plea still more.</p>

<p class="normal">At last, however, he won upon the other. After still more
refusals, M. de Broglie's nephew, having consulted with a second officer of the
troop, yielded by degrees, saying finally that they would remain until daybreak;
would so far forego their duty as to sup and sleep in the castle.</p>

<p class="normal">And now the great gate of the château opened and all the
dragoons of De Broglie and Hérault came in, the horses being tethered in the
courtyard, while the wretched prisoners were told roughly by the second in
command that they could throw themselves down there. Soon, he said, they would
sleep well enough. Need neither pillow nor bolster!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet give us bread,&quot; one whispered, &quot;bread and to drink,
though only water. Kill us not before our time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You shall have both,&quot; the commandant replied. &quot;We do not
starve those to death who are reserved for other things.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They all turned away after this, leaving the prisoners amid
the troopers and the horses, the commandant inviting the two officers to
accompany him and Martin to the platform of the castle, there to await the
supper and the pleasure of being presented to his Excellency's daughter, while,
as they went, Martin, who had been regarding M. de Broglie's nephew from the
first moment when the troop had appeared under the castle, could not resist
saying to him:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur, I can not but think we have met before. Your face
is familiar to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Possibly, monsieur,&quot; the other replied with a courteous bow,
though one that, Martin thought, scarcely savoured of that ease and grace which
a member of the De Broglie family should possess, a great house whose scions
were almost always of a certainty trained to all the courtlinesses of Versailles
and St. Germain. &quot;Possibly, monsieur. I am much about in various places. Can
monsieur,  <i>par hazard</i>, recall where we may have met?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; Martin said, &quot;nay. And 'tis but a light fancy.
Doubtless I am mistaken.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_17" href="#div1Ref_17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h4>

<h5>THE RUSE.</h5>

<p class="normal">Nevertheless he was convinced that he was not mistaken. Yet
where--where had he seen this nephew of De Broglie before?</p>

<p class="normal">As one racks his brain to call up some circumstance or
surrounding in connection with a face that puzzles him, to recollect some action
associated with that face which shall assist the struggle of memory to assert
itself, he racked his brain now. Yet all was of no avail, even though he brought
before his mind every scene he could recollect since first he had returned to
France.</p>

<p class="normal">Of no avail!</p>

<p class="normal">The full deep wig  <i>à la brigadier</i>, the laced blue coat,
the ivory-hilted sword of the young aristocrat, helped him not in the least;
refused rather to assimilate themselves in his memory with the features which
teased his recollection so. Yet, even as he meditated thus, while these four
men--himself, the commandant, the man who perplexed him, and the officer under
him--sat at supper in the old banqueting room used by generations of the De
Servas, he found himself repeating those very words which had risen to his mind,
&quot;the young aristocrat.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Young aristocrat! Well, if so, a strange one, and surely not
possessing the marks of breeding which a De Broglie should be the owner of! He
ate roughly, coarsely, almost it seemed greedily; also he drank as a peasant
drinks, in great copious draughts; laughed noisily and loudly. Moreover, from
out of the ruffles of Valenciennes there protruded hands that scarcely
proclaimed him a member of a well-born family. Hands broad and with ill-shapen
fingers, the nails of which were flat and broken and none too clean; not the
hands of one in whose veins ran the blood of countless well-born men and women!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pity 'tis,&quot; this scion of  <i>la vieille roche</i> muttered
to the commandant, &quot;that mademoiselle does not honour us to-night. Tired, you
say, after the fatigue of her escape from those base fanatics? Ha,
<i>sans doute!</i> May she always escape as easily! 'Twill be well for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke, Martin, removing his eyes from his face, saw a
sight that startled him--a sight that told him something terrible was in the
air.</p>

<p class="normal">Far down, at the end of the old room, there was a small door,
it not being the main one; and at that door, which was open about half a foot,
he saw the face of Urbaine Ducaire, with, on it, an awful look of horror--a
horror which had brought to her face a whiteness such as that which is upon the
countenance of a corpse within its shroud; in her eyes a glare such as is in the
eyes of those who have seen a sight to blast them. A glare, a look of agony,
piteous to see.</p>

<p class="normal">At first he knew not what to do, yet even as he hesitated,
undecided, he felt sure he must not draw the attention of those at the table to
her, unless indeed he could attract the attention of the commandant alone, for
it dawned on him, though he could not have explained why, that she, standing
there behind the door, showing only that white face and those terror-haunted
eyes, had been endeavouring to make the old man see her without being observed
by the others.</p>

<p class="normal">What did it mean? What portend?</p>

<p class="normal">The conversation was eager between the remaining three at the
table, the commandant advancing a plan for trapping the Camisards in their
mountain fastnesses which Julien had a week or so before propounded, the nephew
of De Broglie and his companion listening, it seemed scornfully, certainly
deriding such plan.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will never succeed,&quot; the first of these two said; &quot;never,
never,&quot; and he laughed. &quot;We, we of the king's forces, shall be driven back by
these vile fanatics, or led into a snare, or  <i>guet-apens</i> up in the
mountains. And then woe, woe to all! Not one will return to the valleys, to the
towns, to tell the tale.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet as he spoke, uttered such predictions of disaster, it
seemed almost as though he gloated over the picture he drew.</p>

<p class="normal">And still Martin saw ever before him the terrified face of
Urbaine Ducaire peering from behind the far-off door, the eyes glaring into the
room like the eyes of one who knows that behind her comes some awful thing.
With, in them, too, as it seemed to him, a piteous glance, a glance of agony
that she could not attract the gaze of the man she sought--the commandant.</p>

<p class="normal">He could bear it no longer. Somehow he must reach her,
communicate with her, know what it was that has struck such fear into her soul.</p>

<p class="normal">An excuse for him to leave the table seemed easy. The room had
grown very hot. Already the nephew of De Broglie had protested he must remove
his great wig. The commandant had said they must have air.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will go and open the door,&quot; Martin said, rising from his
place. To open the windows would have been impossible since they were set high
up in the walls, as was the case in most châteaux of the day, and could not be
reached without a ladder. &quot;The one at the farther end.&quot; And as he went toward it
he prayed Heaven none would follow him. Also he saw that the girl's face was
withdrawn as he rose from his chair, the door closed-to gently. Then, a moment
later, he reached it.</p>

<p class="normal">Setting it open, he glanced into the narrow passage that ran
outside, the farthest wall of this corridor having several low windows in it
which gave on to the courtyard; and, turning his eyes into its dimness, he
perceived Urbaine standing there, her back against the wall, her arms extended
droopingly against it too, as though thereby to prevent herself from falling.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mademoiselle,&quot; he said, in a low voice, advancing toward her,
&quot;mademoiselle, what has distressed, terrified you thus? I fear that----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Was she gone mad, he wondered! As he spoke she put both her
hands out in front of her, removing them from the wall and extending them from
her body as though to ward him off, to defend herself from him. Also she pressed
her body back against that wall as if thereby she might shrink into it--away
from him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mademoiselle!&quot; he exclaimed, amazed. &quot;Mademoiselle----&quot; but
paused again, for still she drew herself away from him as from some unclean,
loathsome thing. Then her white lips moved; he heard the words that issued from
them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Traitor!&quot; she said. &quot;Perfidious traitor! Come not near me!&quot;
and with her hands she drew her travelling robe close round her as though to
prevent even that from being contaminated by him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you distraught, mademoiselle?&quot; he asked. &quot;Are----?&quot; yet
stopped once more in his speech, for now, in the dusk of the night, he saw those
staring eyes, which he had deemed so lovely but a few hours ago, glancing out
through the passage window to the courtyard below; saw them rivetted upon
something beneath in that courtyard; saw, too, that she shuddered as she gazed.</p>

<p class="normal">Then he too looked forth into it.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon the stones where the six  <i>attroupés</i> had been flung
down in their chains he saw those men standing now, free and unbound, in their
hands naked weapons. The light of a newly lit flambeau flickering on one of
their blades showed that it was deeply stained red. Also he saw that they too
were now clad in scarlet and blue, their own rude mountain clothes discarded,
flung in a heap in a corner.</p>

<p class="normal">And more he saw! Some were lying dead, or dying, in that
courtyard; men who had but a few hours ago formed part of the garrison; the men
whose clothes the others had already donned.</p>

<p class="normal">Like the lightning's flash there came to his mind what had
happened; he understood all. The ruse was successful. The Camisards, disguised
in the uniforms and trappings of the defeated soldiers of the day before, had
surprised and captured the château; the trick of transporting those false
prisoners had been a perfect one. Also he knew now where he had seen M. de
Broglie's nephew. The deep powdered wig, the rich costume, served as disguises
no longer. He recalled him! Recalled him as one who, young as he was, had taken
a leading part in the massacre of the Abbé du Chaila, in the attack on Poul's
convoy.</p>

<p class="normal">He understood, too, Urbaine's bitter words now. He was of
these men's faith; she deemed him one of them! Also that he had brought her here
only to betray her later into their hands. Bitter words that had sunk into his
heart perhaps forever, yet she should see.</p>

<p class="normal">He drew his sword, advanced a step nearer to her, then
retreated.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I ask your pardon,&quot; he said, speaking very low, &quot;that I have
come near to you again. That I must address you. Yet, 'traitor' as I am, my
place is still by your side. I interfered to save you yesterday. I must go on
with what I have begun. One moment to warn the commandant--if--they have not
slain him--then--then--mademoiselle--to save you from these men of my own
faith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But now she spoke no more, only--her eyes were fixed upon him
with a strange look--he could have sworn that in the almost absolute darkness of
the night which was upon them he saw her bosom heave pitiably. Then from her
lips he heard beyond all doubt a gasp come.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fear not,&quot; he said, &quot;they will not murder a woman. Can not,
at least, murder you while I still live. Remain behind the door while I re-enter
the room.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon, leaving her, he pushed open the door and advanced
within, his sword in his hand. As he did so he saw he had no chance; believed
that he was doomed.</p>

<p class="normal">The room was full of men, of the mock soldiers--the Camisards
disguised in the uniforms of De Broglie and of Hérault; doubtless they had
entered by the main door while he had been in the passage. Also there were
lights in it--two flambeaus placed in old sockets in the walls, and white-wax
candles in a great lustre on the table.</p>

<p class="normal">In front of him was the &quot;nephew of M. de Broglie,&quot; his
powdered wig off now and his head showing a mass of long fair hair, while in his
hand he too held his drawn sword. At the table, his face fallen forward upon it
and his arms outstretched, was the old man, the commandant, done to death.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You craven hound!&quot; hissed Martin, and as he spoke his rapier
darted full at the other. &quot;You craven hound, you eat of that old man's dish,
drink of his cup, and murder him! Defend yourself, assassin!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And, forgetful of any wrong that this man's (his own) faith
might have suffered at the hands of those of the commandant's creed, remembering
only that he was a gentleman face to face with one whom in his heart he deemed
the  <i>canaille</i>, remembering, too, that he was a murderer, he lunged full
at him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Malédiction!</i>&quot; the Camisard exclaimed, driven back by
the skill of the other (skill acquired in many a  <i>cours d'escrime</i> in
Paris, and the fence school of the Guards at Kensington gravel-pits), and
knowing too, himself, but little of sword play except the rough cut-and-thrust
which he had practised in the mountains. &quot;<i>Malédiction!</i> You shall pay
dearly for this!  <i>Au sécours mes frères</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He called for succour none too soon. In another moment
Martin's blade would have been through his breast. None too soon! Fortunately
for him it was at hand. Like tigers rushing on their prey, half a dozen of the
disguised Camisards hurled themselves upon Martin; two threw themselves on him
behind, one knocked up his sword arm, two more secured him. He was disarmed,
captured, at their mercy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shall we knock him on the head or cut his throat, brother
Cavalier?&quot; one asked, while as he did so Martin knew that he stood before one of
the two chiefs of the Cévenoles, a man whose name was a terror by now to all
Languedoc, and, two centuries afterward, is still remembered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Jean Cavalier replied, &quot;he is a bold man, of the
tyrants' side though he be. Most of them will be ours now we have risen. We will
spare him, for the present at least.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he turned to Martin, who stood there calm and
contemptuous (remembering that the fellow before him had been a baker's
apprentice a year or two back, as he had heard--the latter almost felt degraded
at having his life spared by such a man as this), and said with an attempt at
ease which he invariably adopted, and with, also, the fury he had shown gone:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur, it is the fortune of war which puts you in our
power. You must abide by it. What parish do you belong to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None you ever heard of. One in the north of France. I am a
stranger here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A stranger!&quot; Cavalier repeated incredulously, &quot;a stranger!&quot;
And as he did so Martin saw all the followers of the Camisards' chief gazing
astonishedly at him. &quot;A stranger! If so, what are you doing here? What have the
affairs of this unhappy province to do with you? Also, why in this château?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">What answer Martin might have made to his questions, if any,
was not given, since at this moment three of the men who had left the room
returned, bringing with them Urbaine Ducaire. They had found her outside the
door listening tremblingly to all that had happened within, rooted to the spot,
almost insensible.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet now, as she advanced between those men, something had
given her courage, had nerved her to strength. She trembled no more and,
although very white and with still a strange gleam in her eyes, she walked
erect; almost, to Martin observing her, it seemed defiantly. What, he wondered,
had stung her to this courage? Perhaps the contempt that she too felt for her
captors.</p>

<p class="normal">With a bow, Cavalier welcomed her, then asked:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have I the honour to stand face to face with the daughter of
his Excellency the Intendant?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am the adopted daughter of the Comte de Baville,&quot; she
answered calmly. &quot;When do you intend to slay me, as you have slain the others?&quot;
and her eyes stole to where the commandant's body lay stretched over the table.</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment Cavalier looked at her with a strange glance,
surprised, perhaps, at her calmness; it may be, stung by her absolute
indifference to his power. Then he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mademoiselle mistakes those whom she addresses. Doubtless, in
these surroundings, thinks she has fallen into the hands of papists or those of
similar faith. People who slay women burn them on the  <i>grandes places</i>,
belabour their bare backs. I would not be discourteous, yet mademoiselle will
pardon me if I remind her that we are not of the same religion as herself, or
monsieur by her side.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Or monsieur by her side! Unanswering her captor, scarcely
regarding him, she stood there, a look impenetrable to Cavalier upon her face,
yet with her mind full of wonderment.</p>

<p class="normal">Or monsieur by her side! They did not know then that he was
one of them, in faith and belief at least--that--that----</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God!&quot; she whispered to herself, still gazing
beyond--through--the Camisard chief, yet with no thought of him in her mind.
&quot;God! what awful wrong have I done him again to-night, how misjudged him? To be
by my side as a protection still, to share my fate, he does not avow himself a
Protestant; consents to be deemed their enemy--a Catholic. And he is not a
woman. There is naught to save him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as she so thought her eyes stole round and rested on him
standing there calmly near her side, avowing, denying nothing.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_18" href="#div1Ref_18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h4>

<h5>LA DIVINÉRESSE.</h5>

<p class="normal">The violets and the primroses grow in the chestnut woods that
fringe the base of La Lozère, yet disappear as the roads wind up to the summit,
giving place to the wild foxglove and heather which, in their turn, disappear as
still the ascent continues. Also, the chestnuts themselves become more sparse
and infrequent, until at last the woods cease altogether, and the mountaineer
trends only on the soft, crisp brown grass that, lying warm beneath the winter's
snows, springs but into existence to be consumed later by the fierce southern
sun that beats on it.</p>

<p class="normal">Finally, with far beneath his feet the valleys basking in the
warm sun, the wanderer stands upon a dreary upland with, around him, the
mountain tops of the Cévennes huddled in wild confusion, as though thrown down
from the palm of some great giant. A confusion of barren crags in some places,
of, in others, great hills clothed with forests or upland pasturages, or, in a
few cases, plots of cereals--a confusion over which in summer sweeps, without
warning, a torrent of hail, or amidst which rise fogs that envelope all; that in
winter is buried in snow over which the tempests howl. Here, too, wherever the
eye turns, torrents are seen that, when Spring unlocks their floods and turns
the frozen snow to water, leap down and hurl themselves over boulders and, in
some cases, precipices until at last they reach the rivers beneath. Here also
are bare walls of rock in which are the caverns that sheltered the Camisards
whom Louis and Louvois, Chamillart and De Maintenon had driven forth into the
mountain deserts. Yet not only Louis, le Dieudonné and his myrmidons, but,
before him, that other Louis, his father, surnamed &quot;The Just,&quot; who had, under
the sword of the brutal Marshal de Thémines, also driven countless Huguenots to
take refuge in these wild, stony citadels, and had forced them to fortify their
mountains against their persecutors. To close their caverns with bronze doors
secretly conveyed to them by Jeanne d'Albret, Protestant Queen of Navarre.</p>

<p class="normal">It was in one of these vast caves, a week after the Château de
Servas had been burnt to the ground by the orders of Jean Cavalier (of how the
garrison was put to death, none being spared, the peasants still tell nightly to
all who care to hear), that there was gathered a vast company of men and women.
A company assembled to sit in judgment on another man and woman who were in
their power, to say whether the hour had come for the death of those captives or
was still to be postponed. Postponed, not abandoned! For they were Catholics,
persecutors. And, therefore, doomed, sooner or later. But first the prophets and
the prophetesses had to speak. On them depended much; a swift doom that night or
one that might be reserved for another day.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You understand, mademoiselle?&quot; the man said to his companion,
seated by his side; &quot;you understand? Our sentence depends on those gathered
together round Cavalier. After they have spoken we shall know whether 'tis now
or later.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I understand,&quot; Urbaine Ducaire answered, the cold tone in
which he spoke causing more grief to her heart than the awful import of his
words. &quot;I understand.&quot; Then her eyes sought his, met them, and were swiftly
withdrawn.</p>

<p class="normal">They had been here a week, being treated well, allowed to roam
about the vast caverns unmolested, yet never once allowed to form the most
illusory hopes that there could be but one end to their captivity. The knowledge
had been conveyed to them by now and then a word from one or from another, by a
look from a third, by even a glance from Cavalier himself or from Roland, that
for some of the Protestant men and women slaughtered by the Papists they were to
furnish an expiation--a retaliation--as many other Catholics had already done
who had fallen into their captors' hands.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet it was not the crowds of fierce Camisards who now
surrounded them in this great cavern, lit by torches at its farthest end, and by
the rays of the October sun which streamed in from where the great antique
bronze doors, placed there a hundred years ago, stood at the hither end; nor the
unpitying, cruel glances cast by the prophetesses at the girl, which caused the
grief she felt. That came from another cause; from the cold disdain of the man
by her side--the man to whom she owed it that she had not been slain in the
attack made upon her escort. Disdain for the words she had uttered against him
that night in the passage outside the banqueting hall of the Château St. Servas,
for the manner in which she had misjudged him. Misjudged him as she had
recognised well from that night itself, from the moment when, being himself a
Protestant, he had refused to profit by the fact, but, instead, had remained
silent when accused of being one of their captors' enemies. And his reason for
doing so was certain; not to be doubted. So that he might still be by her side,
still near to protect her, still near, if any chance should arise, to aid her
escape. And now the time was at hand when their doom was to be determined, and
yet he continued to hold his peace, would be ready to share her fate, and, she
told herself, to despise her to the end.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are very noble,&quot; she had said to him that morning when
they had been brought into the great cavern from the cells which each had had
assigned to them, &quot;and I, oh, God, how base! I wish the world had ended on that
night, ere I uttered the words I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It matters not,&quot; he said; &quot;is worth no thought. You misjudged
me, that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She bowed her head before him, meaning thereby to acknowledge
how utterly she had indeed misjudged him. Then she said, her eyes fixed on his:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet--yet you will not let them continue in their ignorance of
what you are? If--if they decide to slay, you will announce your fellowship with
them? Is it not so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But to this he would make no answer, turning away his head
from her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It needs but one word,&quot; she continued, &quot;and you are
free--free to go in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He knew as well as she that it needed but one word; nay, he
knew more. It needed but another word--the statement that he was an
Englishman--to make him something more than free, to cause him to be received
with acclamation by their captors, welcomed as a friend. For England was Louis'
bitterest foe and the most powerful; a force slowly crushing the life out of
France and her king, as she had been doing since first she shattered his great
fleet at Barfleur and La Hogue. Also she was the home of every outlawed refugee
and Huguenot; her people supplied them with help and succour; even to this
remote spot money and arms were often secretly sent. And, further, 'twas
whispered among the Protestants that an attack was to be made ere long on
France's Mediterranean coast by one of England's admirals, after which there
would not remain one frontier or border of the land that did not bristle with
Protestant enemies.</p>

<p class="normal">It did indeed need but the words &quot;I am an Englishman&quot; for his
safety to be assured. Yet he had sworn to himself that he would die at his
captors' hands ere he uttered them or made the statement that he was of their
faith, ere he would go forth and leave this girl here, alone and doomed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not desire,&quot; he said, &quot;to earn my release by proclaiming
myself a Protestant. I pity them for what they have suffered; yet--yet I am not
in sympathy with their retaliation. I shall not proclaim myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But now the hum of voices from the crowd near them became
hushed; from their midst one of the prophets, or, as they called them, &quot;<i>Les
Extasés</i>,&quot; was speaking. &quot;Mes Frères,&quot; they heard him say, &quot;the God of
Battles fights on our side, even as once he fought upon the side of Joshua. Also
he has inspired me to read the future. I see,&quot; he went on, extending his hands,
&quot;the time approaching when over all the land of France the Huguenots shall
worship in peace in the way that most befits them; when no longer a tyrannous
king, his married mistress by his side, shall send forth armies to crush them.
Nay, more, I see the time at hand, ay, even in that king's lifetime, when he,
reaping the fruits of his errors, shall find us the allies of his bitterest
foes. I see our brother, Cavalier, leading his troops to victory against France,
against France's own children in a distant land. I see a plain strewed with
their bodies, crimson with their blood shed against France. But not yet, not
yet.&quot;<a name="div4Ref_02" href="#div4_02"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay! not yet. And, my brother, tell us what of the present
your holy visions disclose,&quot; Cavalier exclaimed. &quot;I too can forecast the future
when inspired by God. Speak, therefore, my brother; let us see if God has
revealed to both of us alike.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereupon, again, the seer took up his strain.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Languedoc shall be free at last,&quot; he said. &quot;I see in the far
distant future the altars overturned at which the children of the Devil worship,
the priests of Baal slain, the gibbets empty, the flames burned out. Yet blood
must be shed--the blood of all who bow to false gods, idols of wood and stone,
cruel gods who have spared none of our faith, as now we will spare none of
theirs. 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth.' It is the Mosaic law; let it be
carried out. Spare none.&quot; And even as he spoke his own eyes lighted on the man
and woman sitting there awaiting their doom. Then, lifting up his voice, he
sang, all joining in his song who stood around him, all holding up their hands
to heaven:</p>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:5%">
<p>Seigneur, entend ma plainte, écoute ma prière,<br>
Ne detourne pas ta paupière<br>
De ma détresse, Ô Dieu vivant.<br>
Je pleure, je gémis, j'erre dans les ténebras<br>
Comme aux fentes des tours les hulottes funèbres<br>
Et les oiseaux du Désert.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="normal">And as he spoke, in truth he wept, then flung himself upon his
knees and prayed in silence. Yet looked up at last, and, pointing to Urbaine and
Martin, while down his cheeks the tears rolled, exclaimed: &quot;They are of Baal.
They must die.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You hear?&quot; Martin whispered to his companion, &quot;you hear?
There is no hope; be brave.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Save yourself,&quot; she whispered back. &quot;Save yourself, or,&quot; and
now her eyes sought his boldly, &quot;I proclaim you--save you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You dare not, I forbid you: command you to hold your peace.
If you proclaim me one of them, I will deny it. Be silent.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It seemed as if there would be no time for her to do as she
threatened; their doom was at hand.</p>

<p class="normal">Down the long cavern the Camisards advanced slowly. Ahead of
them strode Cavalier; yet even as he came he turned to those behind him and said
some words as though endeavouring to calm them, to at least retard the hour of
their vengeance; yet also, as it seemed by his face, with little hope of being
able to do so.</p>

<p class="normal">Ahead of all came the women. One, who limped as she walked,
Martin recognised as the girl Fleurette who had been dragged moaning from the
Abbé du Chaila's house; another was the girl whom Urbaine had seen fire the shot
which slew her companion, the  <i>gouvernante</i>. Also there were others, some
old, some middle-aged, some almost children. And, perhaps to nerve themselves to
what they were about to do, one told of how her babe had been cast into the
flames at Nîmes &quot;by order of Baville--her father,&quot; pointing as she spoke to
Urbaine; another of how her boy had hung upon a lamp post at Anduse &quot;by order of
Baville--her father&quot;; a third of how her old mother, gray and infirm, had also
been consigned to the flames &quot;by order of Baville--her father.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She, standing there, did not flinch as they approached; stood,
indeed, calmly awaiting whatever they might be about to do to her--she who had
shrieked as the shot was fired at Poul's escort, who had seemed as one blasted
to death by what she had discovered in the Château de Servas. Neither flinched
nor blanched, indeed smiled once into Martin's eyes as he, close by her side,
took her hand gently in his; glanced swiftly up into his eyes as though asking
if, at this supreme moment, he forgave.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We die together,&quot; he said. &quot;Remember, be brave.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thus,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I fear nothing.&quot; Then murmured, even
lower, &quot;My God! how great, how noble you are!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Suddenly, while now the Camisards were all around them and
while Cavalier's voice rang out through the vaulted cavern, bidding them halt
until they had decided what form of death should be meted out to the prisoners,
a woman's voice rose high above all the others, commanding them to harken to her
words, listen to the spirit of prophecy that was upon her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the Grande Marie,&quot; they said, &quot;La Grande Marie. Hear
her, hear her!&quot; and stood still as they spoke, glancing at her.</p>

<p class="normal"><i>Grande</i> she was in stature, big and gaunt, with wild,
misty eyes that seemed to glare into vacancy; her hair iron-gray and
dishevelled, her voice rich and full as it rang down the cavern, silencing all
other voices.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The skies whirl round in starry circles,&quot; she said. &quot;The
voices of whispering angels are in my ears, the heavenly host are telling me
strange things. Also the voice of God speaks to me; asks me a question. Asks me
who it is we are about to slay? My brethren, answer for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who?&quot; they shouted, &quot;who?&quot; Cavalier alone standing silent,
his eyes upon the Grande Marie in wonderment. &quot;Who? A stranger, who is of the
persecutors' faith. A woman also of the devil--the child of Baville--the
persecutor--the murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The misty eyes roamed over all around her as they spoke. Then
suddenly she moved toward them, her hand extended, one finger pointing. And with
that finger she touched Cavalier on the arm, then the Camisard next to him, then
another; then a woman, and another woman.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All,&quot; she whispered, while a great hush was now upon those in
the cavern, &quot;all are God's children, all servitors of the Cross--all, all, all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again she went on, passing slowly by those in the cave, her
finger touching each and every one, missing none. Peering, too, into their faces
with those wild clouded eyes, penetrating them with her glances.</p>

<p class="normal">And now the silence was extreme. She had touched, had looked
into the face of every one there except Martin and Urbaine.</p>

<p class="normal">Again she moved and approached him, standing tall, erect and
calm, yet not defiantly, before his captor.</p>

<p class="normal">Her fingers advanced and touched his breast beneath where the
lace of his cravat fell. With every eye upon them, she brought her face close to
his, and for one minute seemed as if through her own eyes she would see deep
into his brain. Then moved a step farther and stood before Urbaine Ducaire.</p>

<p class="normal">The girl, standing herself motionless, her hand clasped in
Martin's, divined rather than felt that the finger of the prophetess was on her
breast; saw that, as she opened her lids which she had closed when that wild
form drew near her, the eyes of the seer were looking into hers. Then shuddered
as they were removed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Away!&quot; La Grande Marie exclaimed, as now there were no more
to touch, no more to penetrate with those terrible glances, &quot;away to your work
in the valleys and the towns, to devastate, to destroy, when the moon which is
the sun of the outcast is on high. Away, I say, to destroy, to devastate. Your
work is not here. Our God has blinded you, led you astray. In this, our refuge,
there is no child of the devil, no Papist. You are deceived. Those whom you
would slay are of our faith!&quot;</p>

<h5>LEX TALIONIS.</h5>

<p class="normal">Over all Languedoc there was an awful terror at this time--the
terror that is born of successful rebellion, and that rebellion the outcome of a
religious strife.</p>

<p class="normal">An awful terror which filled now the breasts of those who had
erstwhile been the persecutors, even as, not long before, it had filled the
breasts of those whom they had persecuted.</p>

<p class="normal">In truth there were none in all that fair province, none--from
those who dwelt on its southern borders washed by the sapphire-hued waters of
the Mediterranean, to those who, on its northern boundary, gazed toward the
fertile provinces of Linois and Auvergne, or, looking west, saw the rich rolling
lands of golden Guienne stretched out before them--but felt, and feeling,
dreaded, the threatening horror that at any moment might engulf them. For now no
longer were the dungeons of the cities filled with Protestants moaning for
water, food, or air; no longer did Huguenot women offer their jailers the few
miserable coins they had about them so that their babes might taste a drop of
milk; no longer did men of the Reformed Faith offer their little bags of
secreted livres and tournois to their warders, so that thereby they might be
allowed to sleep one hour--only one little hour!--without disturbance; without
horns being blown at their dungeon doors to awaken them, or blank charges fired
from musketoons and fusils with a like intent; without their bodies being
pricked and stirred up by point of lance or sword at the moment that a
heartbroken slumber fell upon them.</p>

<p class="normal">A change had come! Some of the jails were emptied now; in the
smaller towns and villages they existed no longer. Some of those towns and
villages were themselves erased from off the face of the earth. Down from their
mountain homes the Camisards had stolen, creeping like phantoms through the
night, like panthers on the trail of those whom they track to their doom, like
adders gliding through the grass. One by one these men of vengeance mustered
outside doomed bourgs or hamlets till all were assembled in a compact mass,
sometimes to lay violent and open siege to the places, sometimes to be admitted
silently at dead of night, or in early dawn, by those who, disguised, had
already stolen in. Then the massacre took place, the jails gave up their victims
who were not already dead, the hateful gibbets and the iron-bound wheels helped
to light the fires that consumed the villages, and in the morning there was no
sign left either of avenger or of victim. Of the former, all had stolen back
into their impenetrable fastnesses; of the latter, nothing remained but burning
houses and crumbling walls, a church destroyed, an altar shattered, and at its
base a slaughtered priest.</p>

<p class="normal">Even in the greater cities--in Montpellier and Nîmes, Alais
and Uzès--the haunting fear, the terror, the horror was there, even though those
cities were fortified and garrisoned, full of soldiers and
<i>milices</i>. Yet of what use were these? Of what use dragoons who had fought
in close ranks and knee to knee against William of Orange's own English and
Dutch troopers? Of what use infantry who had stood a solid phalanx of steel
under Bouflers and Luxembourg? Of what use a homely militia, when the enemy was
unseen and intangible--an enemy which crept in man by man through gates and
barriers, disguised as peasant and farmer bringing in produce, or sometimes, in
bitter mockery of their foes, as Catholic priest or Catholic seigneur? It was
not strange that against such a foe as this all Baville's plans were unavailing,
all Julien's military knowledge helpless. And the question which every man asked
his neighbour was, Would Montrevel, the new field marshal now on his way from
Paris with an enormous army, be able to succeed against such crafty and resolute
enemies any better than his predecessors had done?</p>

<p class="normal">Baville asked himself the same question now, as he sat where
he had sat a month or two before, on that morning when across the room had
fallen the shadow of Urbaine as she came in from the garden, her hands full of
freshly gathered, dew-sprinkled flowers--his loved Urbaine. Yet he told himself,
even as thus he meditated and doubted, that if force could do it, it should be
done.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon his face as he sat alone in his cabinet there was a look
which none could perhaps have interpreted, yet which none could have failed to
observe; a look that had brought an appearance of age to his face which his
fifty years of life should not have placed there; also a look of deep, fierce
determination which, cruel as he had ever been, had not hitherto been
perceptible upon his handsome features. On the table before him there lay a
great chart of the whole Cévennes district; attached to the chart by a silken
string was a paper referring to it; on the back of that chart was written in a
bold, sprawling hand, the words, &quot;Mon plan pour la grande battue des attroupés
que je projete,&quot; and signed &quot;Julien.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bah,&quot; Baville exclaimed, after throwing down these papers
angrily, &quot;<i>sa grande battue! Son plan!</i> What will come of it? What?
Nothing. These dogs are as slippery as snakes. No battue will surround, entrap
them. And--and--even though they, though this swashbuckler, who thinks more of
the bouquet of his Celestin or the aroma of his white Frontignan than of our
province's safety, should prevail, it will not bring her back to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And Baville, on whose soul there lay heavy the slaughter of
countless innocent women--their only fault their faith--buried his face in his
hands and moaned. &quot;Urbaine, Urbaine,&quot; he whispered, &quot;<i>Ma mignonne, ma petite
rose blanche</i>, to think of you in their hands, you whom we have nurtured so
soft and warm, you who, I swore to your father, should be my life's charge, the
star of my existence! Fool! fool! fool! to ever let you go thus. Though God he
knows,&quot; he whispered still, &quot;I did it for the best; did it, knowing the dangers
that threatened, that were surely coming, that must above all else strike at
Baville and his. Deemed I could save you, send you away to peace and safety.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And still he sat on there, his head in his hands, while from
between his fingers the tears trickled as he muttered still, &quot;Urbaine, Urbaine!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is dead,&quot; he said after a pause. &quot;She must be dead. Of
all, they would not spare her--my lamb. That is enough--to belong to me! O God!&quot;
he cried, springing from his chair and clasping his hands above his head,
&quot;nothing can give her back to me. Yet one thing thou canst give me: Vengeance!
vengeance! vengeance! On him, above all, on that treacherous Huguenot, that
viper who, when there was still a chance left, dragged her from the carriage,
gave her up to his accursed brethren. Give me that! Place him but once in my
hands and I ask no more. Urbaine can never come back, but at least she shall lie
in her grave--where is it?&quot;--and he shuddered--&quot;lie in her grave avenged. Why
did I ever trust him--kinsman of the de Rochebazons as he is--why not execute
him that night at Montvert?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">After the rout of Poul's escort and of De Broglie's soldiers
in an adjacent place by the Camisards, some half dozen of the dragoons of
Hérault had managed to escape from the former slaughter, as well as many more
from the latter. As has been said, they fled to Nîmes, where Baville was at the
time, bringing with them the full account of what had happened to both
detachments, and in their dismay and confusion making the disaster none the less
in the telling. Now, among those who had thus escaped was one, a young  <i>
porte-guidon</i>, or cornet, who had by chance ridden also with De Peyre's
detachment to Montvert when in attendance on Baville and the abbé's nephew. And
there this lad had seen Martin upon the bridge with Buscarlet, had heard
something of the conversation which ensued; knew, too, that he had returned to
Alais with them. Therefore he was acquainted with Martin's appearance so well
that, when the distracted Intendant had demanded from those who had escaped
where his child was, he was very well able to inform him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God!&quot; Baville exclaimed, sitting in his rooms in the old
Roman city, with the lad before him and surrounded by half the councillors of
the place, sitting there white to the lips, &quot;you saw it, saw him drag her out of
the carriage, ride away with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I saw it, your Excellency, beyond all doubt. And had it not
been that I dared not take my eyes off these Camisards who were attacking
me--one of the villains was armed with a reaping hook--I would have made a
stroke to save mademoiselle; have hamstrung his horse, run him through. But,
your Excellency sees,&quot; and he pointed to his hand, a mass of rags and bandages,
&quot;two fingers are gone; cut off as I wrested the brutal weapon from the man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which road did he take?--yet, why ask?&quot; Baville had said.
&quot;Which road would he go but one--that toward their accursed mountain dens? And
he--he was of their faith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later he interrogated the young dragoon again.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can you by no chance be mistaken about this man? Think, I
beseech you! Of all, she could have fallen into no worse hands than his.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is impossible, your Excellency. It is the man who sat on
the bridge with the curé when we rode into Montvert--the man who returned to
Alais with us. Also, I have spoken with him in Montpellier when your Excellency
made him welcome at the Intendancy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Beneath his lips Baville muttered a bitter imprecation as the
young officer recalled this fact. It was, he saw now, a fatal error to have
committed. Yet--yet he had done it of set purpose, for a reason. No, he would
dwell no more on that. And now weeks had passed since Urbaine's disappearance.
She must be dead, he and his wife had told each other a thousand times by night
and day.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Every hope is gone,&quot; he said to her more than once, &quot;every
hope. She was mine--known to a hundred mountain refugees from Montpellier to be
ours. They would not spare her. There is nothing left but vengeance, if he, that
kinsman of the de Rochebazons, ever falls into our hands, as he must, as he
must. They can not triumph forever. Can not win in the end.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Madame l'Intendante came in to him now as he sat in his room,
a gentle, handsome woman on whose face the grief she felt within was very
plainly apparent; came in, and, touching his forehead softly with her hand, sat
down by his side.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nicole,&quot; she said, &quot;a thought has come to me that--that--my
God that I should have to say it!--if Urbaine is still alive, might lead to her
rescue.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A thought!&quot; he exclaimed, his face brightening. &quot;A thought!
What thought? Yet what can a thousand thoughts avail? She is Baville's. That
dooms her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Mon mari</i>, suppose--only suppose--they have not slain
her--nay, deny me not,&quot; as her husband made an impatient movement, &quot;suppose they
have not slain her yet. Remember, she would be a great hostage, and they, these
rebels, boast they seek not warfare, but only peace--concessions; offer to lay
down their arms if--if--all they ask for their unhappy, mistaken religion is
granted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well,&quot; Baville replied, yet looking eagerly at her, &quot;well,
what then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To bring about a truce, obtain those concessions. They may
have spared her life, if only for a time, if only for a time,&quot; she repeated,
sobbing now.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Even though they have done so,&quot; her husband replied,
&quot;concessions are impossible, though I myself desired them. Julien is maddened at
his total failure; he will grant none. Montrevel comes full of pride at gaining
his long-desired  <i>bâton</i>. It is not to make peace, grant concessions, that
he is on his way. Rather to cause more slaughter, extermination. And for  <i>her</i>--there,&quot;
and his eyes wandered toward the direction where, hundreds of leagues away,
Paris and the great white palace of Versailles lay, &quot;will she grant any?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Madame l'Intendante knew well enough to whom he referred--to  <i>
la femme funeste et terrible</i>--and shook her head sadly, while Baville
continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She bars all, blocks all, Alice,&quot; and he lowered his voice
instinctively. &quot;Alice, it is she who has lit this torch of rebellion through all
Languedoc. Chamillart writes me that Louis has known nothing until now of what
has been happening. She has kept him in ignorance until forced by my demand for
a great army and the services of Montrevel to tell him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God! What duplicity!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is true. She holds him in the hollow of her hand, winds
him round her finger as a child winds a silken thread. Will she grant
concessions, do you think?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But, Nicole, listen. If she, Urbaine, lives, there may be
still time. Montrevel is not yet here. His great army moves slowly. Time,
still.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you forgotten? Her real father--that friend of
yours--Monsieur Ducaire--have you not often told me he was himself of their
faith--a Huguenot?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; Baville exclaimed, &quot;it is so. He was. Yet, again,
what then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If--if she does still live, and it could be communicated to
them, they would perhaps spare her. Surely, among the old of those
refugees--even among those who are now but elderly--there may be some who would
remember her father, could recall this Monsieur Ducaire----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She paused, alarmed at the strange effect of her words, for
Baville's face had turned an ashen hue as she spoke. Almost it seemed to his
wife as though his handsome features were convulsed with pain as he, repeating
those words, whispered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Recall Ducaire? Remember her father? Oh! Dieu des Dieux, if
they should do that, if there should be one among those who surround her, if she
still lives, who could do so! If there is but one who should tell her----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What, Baville?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no, no!&quot; he whispered. &quot;No, no! If so--yet it can not
be!--but if it is, if there is any still living to tell her that, then better
she be dead. Better dead than bear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Husband,&quot; Madame l'Intendante said, &quot;I know now, something
tells me--alas! alas! ever have I suspected it, feared it,&quot; and she wrung her
hands; &quot;you have deceived me, trifled with me from the first. Baville, is it
you? Are you in solemn truth her father? Is Ducaire another name, known once in
the far-off past, for Baville? Would she be better dead than alive to learn
that? Answer me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;no; you do not understand, can not understand;
must not know yet. But I am innocent of that wrong to you. I swear it. And
Alice, my wife,&quot; he continued as he bent over her and kissed her brow, &quot;Alice,
my love, if you knew all you would pity me. Alice, I swear it to you--swear that
it is not what you think.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as again he kissed her, he murmured the old French
proverb:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tout savoir c'est tout pardonner,&quot; adding, &quot;Oh, believe in
me, counsel me, my wife.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_20" href="#div1Ref_20">CHAPTER XX.</a></h4>

<h5>WHAT IS THIS MYSTERY?</h5>

<p class="normal">The swallows were gone--a month earlier in this mountainous
region than in the rest of the golden south of France. Below, the corn had
fallen ungathered from its stalks, since of those who remained in the valleys,
and faithful to the iron rule of Baville, none dared reap it, for fear that,
while doing so, from its midst might spring up a body of the dreaded Camisards.
Already, too, high up in the mountains, the first flurries of snow had sprinkled
the ground; autumn had come. And still Baville was no nearer to finding Urbaine,
or to gathering news of whether she was alive or dead, than he had been before.
Neither did he know what had become of the man who, he deemed, had betrayed her
into his enemies' hands; who, he believed, had sent her to her death.</p>

<p class="normal">Meanwhile, Montrevel had arrived. Montrevel, the general and
newly created field marshal, second only to Tallard, who next year lost
Blenheim, and to Villars, who was ordained later to bring peace to the
distracted land. Montrevel, of whom it was said that he fought like a Paladin of
old, made love like a Troubadour, and had the air of a hero of the stage or the
leader of a chorus in the newly invented operas.</p>

<p class="normal">With him came a vast army--one which, to any other rebels but
the all-triumphant Protestants, harbouring defiantly in the mountain deserts on
high and in the inaccessible caverns, would have brought fear and terror. To
them, however, this army brought none. &quot;<i>Nous sommes les rochers que les vents
combattants en vaine</i>,&quot; they cried, and even as they so taunted their late
persecutors they stole down by night and by unknown paths, sacked a fresh
village, provided themselves with fresh food, more arms and more ammunition,
seized on costly uniforms and laces, and, when possible, horses and cattle,
while once more like phantoms they vanished quietly afterward from human sight.
Vanished as the crawling Indians whom some of their adversaries had encountered
on the Mississippee or the St. Lawrence; vanished, after devastating lonely
settlements and townships; disappeared as disappears the snowflake which falls
on the bosom of the ocean, is seen a moment, and then is gone forever.</p>

<p class="normal">In that army, sent to destroy the men whose retaliation of
half a century's persecution was now so terrible, came soldiers who had never
yet known defeat. From Italy the Marquis de Firmacon brought back the men of a
regiment of cuirassiers who had fought like victorious tigers at Cremona and had
even driven back the fiery Eugene and his soldiers before their rush; in that
army also were the guards of Tarnaud, De Saulx, and Royal Comtois; marines who
had faced Russel's and Shovel's squadrons; dragoons of Saint-Sernin who had seen
Marlborough ride all along the line giving orders to the great English force to
advance, and had observed, but a year or two before, the consumptive invalid,
William of England and Holland, stand undismayed beneath a hailstorm of bullets
while superintending the siege of some great fortress in the Netherlands. Also
there came the brigade of Lajonquiére which had followed Turenne in victory and
defeat, and that of Marsilly which had stood shoulder to shoulder awaiting the
orders of Condé to charge. And still there were others who might have struck
more terror to any mountain rebels than these trained battalions; a regiment of
men, themselves mountaineers, whose fierceness and brutality were a byword
through all the South.</p>

<p class="normal">These were the Miquelets, a body of six hundred Pyrenean
soldiers under the command of a rough one-armed free lance named De Palmerolles.
From sunny Roussillon and Foix these men came, their faces burned black, their
bodies half clad in red shirts and trousers, resembling sailors' slops in
vastness,  <i>espardillos</i>, or shoes of twisted cord, upon their feet, in
their belts two pistols on one side, a scimitar dagger on the other, while in
their hands they bore the long-barrelled  <i>gyspe</i> peculiar to the Pyrenean.
Also, to render greater Montrevel's chance of defeating those who were termed
rebels to the king, he brought with him twenty large brass cannons, five
thousand bullets, four thousand muskets, and fifty thousand pounds of
powder--enough, in truth, to defeat all the rebels in the Cévennes, if they
could only be got at.</p>

<p class="normal">From far up on the height of La Lozère, sheltered in a small
copse of wind-swept firs, Jean Cavalier, looking down on the road which wound
from Genoillac to Alais, laughed lightly as he turned to the companions by his
side--his comrade, Roland, and his prisoner, Martin Ashurst.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In truth,&quot; he said, &quot;'tis a brave array of men. Yet what will
they do against us? They can never get up here in spite of Baville's recently
constructed roads, while as for us we can get down and back again as we choose.&quot;
Then, turning to Martin, he said politely, and with that attempt at gracious
ease and condescension which he never forgot to assume:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur, I know we are safe with you. When you and your
charge, Mademoiselle Ducaire, have left us you will betray no secrets.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No more,&quot; replied Martin, &quot;than I should betray any of
Monsieur Baville's to you. You know now that, though I am of your religion, I am
no partisan of either side. I pray God the day may come when all of our faith
may be free, happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We pray so, too,&quot; both chiefs answered, while Cavalier
continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Tis what we seek. Peace--peace above all! And we are no
rebels to the king. Let him but give us leave to worship in our own way and
unmolested, earn our bread undisturbed, pay no taxes that go to support his own
Romish church--the other taxes we will willingly pay--and he will find he has no
more loyal subjects than the Cévenoles. Nay, have we not offered our services to
him against his enemies, offered to furnish a Protestant regiment to aid him in
Spain against the Austrian claimant, to fight against all his foes except the
English, our brother Protestants? Yet he will not consent that it shall be so,
or, rather, those who dominate him in his old age will not let him listen to
us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Therefore,&quot; said Roland, &quot;let him look to himself.
See--hearken to those Miquelets who tread the plains now, shrieking their
barbaric songs. Do you know what their war-cry is? 'Tis 'war to the knife.' So
be it; 'tis ours too. And ere we cease to shout it Louis will have given in to
us. While one Protestant remains in these mountains we shall never yield. The
king may conquer Europe, drive back all his enemies; us he will never conquer.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">After La Grande Marie had uttered these words of hers, &quot;Those
whom you would slay are of our faith,&quot; there had fallen a great silence on all
within the vast vaulted cavern--a silence begotten of wonderment, yet a
wonderment which had in it no element of disbelief; for of all the prophetesses,
she it was who was most believed in by the Camisards, her inspiration the one
which they had never yet known to be at fault. She had advised the descent to
Montvert, fortelling how, on that night, the abbé should atone for his crimes at
their avenging hands in spite of their not seeking his death. She also it was
who had bidden them attack the convoy of Urbaine under the hated command of
Poul, and the detachment under the equally hated command of De Broglie. Had
prophesied, too, that in that convoy should be found one whose capture and death
would wring the heartstrings of the tyrant Baville as nothing else could wring
them, would beat him down to misery, might even force him in his despair to
abandon all further cruelties toward those of his creed.</p>

<p class="normal">And what she had prophesied had all come to pass. Baville's
daughter, as most of them supposed Urbaine to be, was in their hands, her death
assured. Therefore now, also, they believed her prophetic visions and
utterances, though, in believing, a victim thereby escaped them. Even the
women--whose bitterness, born of the horrors practised on their own helpless
babes and their old back-bowed mothers and fathers, as well as on themselves,
was more intense than that of the men who, in their hearts, felt for the white
delicate girl who stood a prisoner before them--even the women paused,
wondering, amazed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of our faith,&quot; they muttered, &quot;of our faith. Yet the wolf's
own cub, the persecutor's own blood. Marie, sister, think again of what you say.
Pause and reflect.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know what I say,&quot; La Grande Marie murmured, the misty eyes
still fixed upon the girl before her, her hand half raised. &quot;God has entered my
heart, given me the power of divination. She and he, this man by her side, are
of our faith. Is it not so, little one?&quot; and she leaned forward to a child near
her upon whom also the gift of prophecy was reported to have fallen.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is so, Marie,&quot; the child lisped.<a name="div4Ref_03" href="#div4_03"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is the mystery?&quot; Cavalier asked, standing before
Urbaine, his voice expressing the surprise he felt at the turn matters had
assumed, expressing also his awe, for he, too, was sometimes visited with the
impulse of prophecy. &quot;In God's name explain, mademoiselle.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is no explanation to offer. Your prophetess is wrong.
Since my father adopted me I have known no faith but the true one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Adopted you!&quot; he repeated, while all round them stood
listening eagerly. &quot;Ah! yes, I have heard; remember you said such was the case
at the Château de Servas, yet had forgotten. Mademoiselle, what is your name
since it can not be Baville?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Urbaine Ducaire.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ducaire?&quot; he repeated, &quot;Ducaire? There is no name such as
that in the lists of our unhappy brethren. Mademoiselle,  <i>was</i> your father
of our religion?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know not,&quot; the girl replied, while in her manner, in her
eyes, too, was the haughty indifference to her captor which had surprised
Cavalier from the first. &quot;I know not. Yet, since he was M. de Baville's friend,
it scarce seems possible he should have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Listen,&quot; cried the Camisard chief, addressing all those who
stood around, &quot;listen, my brethren. Among you are many no longer young, many who
can cast their memories back to the years ere this--this demoiselle--could have
been born. Some, too, who come from far and wide, from where the waters of the
sea lap our southern shores; from where, also, Guienne on one side, Dauphiné on
the other, touch our border. Heard ever any of you of a Huguenot named Ducaire?&quot;
and as he spoke he cast his eyes around all within the cavern.</p>

<p class="normal">But there came no affirmative answer. Only the repetition of
that name and the shaking of heads, and glances from eyes to eyes as each looked
interrogatively at the other.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There must be some who, at least, have heard this name if--if
La Grande Marie divines truly--if this lady is in truth of our faith.
Yet--yet--the gift may have failed her now, have misled her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Test that gift, Cavalier,&quot; La Grande Marie exclaimed from
where she stood now among the others, and speaking in a clear voice, while her
filmy eyes, which seemed ordinarily to be peering into far-off space, rested on
him. &quot;Test that gift. The woman is not the only one named as being of our faith.
Ask of the man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As she spoke the eyes of Urbaine and Martin met, the minds of
each filled with the same thought. The knowledge that whereas hitherto to have
declared himself of their captors' faith would have led to his being set free
and no longer able to share her doom, his doing so now would almost beyond all
doubt prevent that doom from falling on her.</p>

<p class="normal">The acknowledgment that La Grande Marie had divined justly in
his case would cause them to believe that she had also done so in Urbaine's.</p>

<p class="normal">And knowing this--as she too, he felt, must know it--he did
not hesitate.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She has pronounced justly,&quot; he said. &quot;I am of the Reformed
faith. A Protestant.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Amid the murmurs that arose from all who surrounded those two
prisoners, amid their cries, in some cases exultant ones, that La Grande Marie
had never yet been mistaken and was not, could not be so now; amid, too, their
strongly expressed opinion that, since she had been right as regards the man,
therefore also she must be so as regards the woman, Cavalier exclaimed:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In heaven's name why not say so before? Also why risk your
life as you have done at the Château de Servas and here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She was alone and defenceless,&quot; Martin exclaimed. &quot;I desired
to protect her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Knowing that she too is a Protestant, by birth at least?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, knowing only that she was a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet Baville's cherished ward?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, his cherished ward.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Cavalier shrugged his shoulders and turned away. Perhaps the
bitter sufferings of all of his, of their, faith were too present to his mind to
make that mind, young as it was--he being not twenty--capable of understanding
such magnanimity. Also he did not know that the man before him belonged to a
land where, for now nearly fifteen years, none had suffered for their religious
opinions as over all France they suffered horribly and were to suffer for still
some years to come, and that, consequently, he could not feel as strongly as
they themselves felt.</p>

<p class="normal">Whatever Cavalier might think, however, of the motives which
had prompted a man who avowed himself a Protestant to protect the worshipped
idol of the Protestant's greatest persecutor in the most persecuted part of
France, one thing was very certain: neither would be put to death--the one
because he was undoubtedly of their faith, the other because, not being the
actual child of Baville, she might in truth have been born a Huguenot, as La
Grande Marie had had revealed to her. La Grande Marie! in whose auguries and
predictions they believed for the simple reason that, until now, all that she
had foretold, all that she had uttered as prophetic inspiration, had come to
pass.</p>

<p class="normal">They were safe so far!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_21" href="#div1Ref_21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;YOU WILL NEVER FIND HIM.&quot;</h5>

<p class="normal">&quot;When you and your charge, Mademoiselle Ducaire, have left us
you will betray no secrets,&quot; Cavalier had said to Martin, as they stood side by
side watching the army of Montrevel on its way through the province? Yet some
weeks passed, and still they remained in the hands of the Camisards, well
treated, yet still there.</p>

<p class="normal">For their accommodation two large caverns had been prepared as
sleeping rooms; prepared, too, in such a manner as would indeed have astonished
the Camisards' enemies, the dwellers in the valleys below, had they been able to
observe them. To observe that Urbaine's chamber--if such a name could be given
to the vault in which she slept--was furnished not only with comfort, but indeed
luxury, her bed, which had been constructed expressly for her by one of the
<i>attroupés</i> who was a carpenter, being covered with fine white linen and
made soft with skins and rugs. Also the sides of the vault were hung with
tapestry and brocade; the ewer from which she poured water was solid silver; the
floor on which she trod was covered with carpets made at Aubusson. Yet the girl
shuddered as, nightly, daily, she glanced round this luxuriously furnished
cavern, knowing full well, or at least being perfectly able to divine, whence
all these things came; for none who had ever knelt, as Urbaine had done since
her earliest recollection, at the altar of any church of the Ancient Faith could
doubt that that silver jug had been torn from some such altar which had been
devastated with the edifice itself; none who had seen the luxurious fittings and
adornments of the  <i>noblesse</i> of Languedoc could doubt that the tapestries
and hangings and rich fine linen had once adorned the château of Catholic
noblemen or gentlemen. Everything which surrounded her, all--even to the choice
plate off which they both ate their meals, and the crystal glass from which they
drank the Ginestoux and Lunel placed before them--told the same story; the story
of robbery and pillage, of an awakened vengeance that spared nothing and
hesitated at nothing.</p>

<p class="normal">Both, too, were free now, free to wander on the mountain
slopes, no parole being demanded, since escape was impossible through those
closely guarded paths and defiles, a little mule being at the girl's service
when she chose to use it, an animal which had been captured from Julien's forces
during a defeat sustained by him and while bearing on its back two mountain
guns. Now those guns guarded, with other captured cannon, one of the approaches
from the valley, and the mule was given over entirely to her service. Yet she
rarely rode it, preferring, indeed, to sit upon a high promontory whence, at
sunset, she could see the spires of distant cathedrals or churches sparkling far
down in the valley, sometimes with Martin by her side, sometimes alone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur,&quot; she said to him now one crisp, sunny October
afternoon as together they strolled toward this promontory to watch the sunset,
&quot;monsieur, why do you not go away, return to your own land? You will have the
chance soon to escape out of France forever. You heard what the chief said last
night, that an English agent was at Nîmes endeavouring to discover what chance
the fleet in the Mediterranean will have of invading us there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You forget, mademoiselle. I am in their power; you forget
that----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;why speak thus? I know that you are
free to go to-morrow, to-night; that you might have gone long since had you
chosen. That you remain here only because you will not leave me alone in their
power. I know, I understand,&quot; and the soft, clear eyes stole a glance into his.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I saved you once, by God's mercy,&quot; he said. &quot;I shall not
leave you now. Not until I return you to your father's arms. And take heart! It
will not be long. Whether Montrevel or my countrymen effect a landing from the
sea, you will be soon free. If the former happens, it will be a rescue; if the
latter, you will be detained no longer, since they deem you beyond all doubt a
Protestant.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The woman was mistaken,&quot; she answered. &quot;It is impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet Cavalier thinks he has confirmation of the fact. You know
that he has been in the valleys lately, even in Montpellier, disguised. He has
met one, an old woman, who knew Monsieur Ducaire, your real father. You know
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She has said so, yet I deem it impossible. Who is this
woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She will not say. But he seems confident. And--and--even
though my religion is so hateful to you--think, think, I beseech you, of what
advantage to you it is to be deemed here one of our faith. Mademoiselle, if that
strange seer, that prophetess whose knowledge astounds, mystifies me, had not
proclaimed you one of them and a Protestant, you would have been dead by now,&quot;
and he shuddered as he spoke.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You wrong me,&quot; she said, &quot;when you say that the
Protestant--that your--faith is hateful to me. It is only that I have been
taught from my earliest days to believe so strongly in my own, to regard nothing
as true but that. Also,&quot; she continued, &quot;because it is yours, the religion of
you who have saved me, it could never be hateful to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And as she spoke the soft rose-blush came to her cheek and her
eyes fell. To her, and to Cavalier, Martin Ashurst had given a full account of
himself, concealing nothing, and at last not even hesitating to avow himself an
Englishman, a fact which, if known in any other part of Louis' dominions but
this Protestant and rebel stronghold, would have led to his instant destruction.
For England was pressing France sorely now, trampling her under the iron heel of
the vast armies headed by Marlborough, attacking her on every coast she
possessed, even now sending a fleet under Sir Cloudesley Shovel to attempt a
landing at Cette and Toulon to succour and aid the Huguenots. Also it was to her
principally that France's cruelly-used subjects had been fleeing for years, by
her that they had been warmly welcomed and humanely treated. What hopes of
anything short of a swift and awful death could an Englishman hope for at this
time if caught in France?</p>

<p class="normal">Yet that he was safe in telling Urbaine Ducaire who and what
he was he never doubted, even though she, in her turn, should tell Baville; for,
since he meant himself to restore her to Baville's arms, it was not too much to
suppose that this restoration would cancel the awful crime, in the eyes of the
man who cherished this girl so, of being a British subject.</p>

<p class="normal">Also he had told both of what had brought him to
Languedoc--his quest for the last of the de Rochebazons--and of how that quest
had failed up to now, must fail entirely, since it was impossible that any
investigations could be carried on in the distracted state of the province at
the present time. Nor did Cavalier, whose mind would have better become a man of
forty than one of twenty, give him any encouragement to hope that he would ever
find the man he sought.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For,  <i>figurez vous</i>,&quot; he remarked, &quot;this land, this
sweet, fair Languedoc, has been a prey to dissension, slaughter, upon one side
only up till now&quot; (and he laughed grimly as he spoke, perhaps at the change
which had come about), &quot;to misery and awful wrongs for how long? Long before
this present king--this  <i>Dieudonné</i>, this  <i>Roi Soleil</i>--came to the
throne, and when his father  <i>Le Juste</i> was harrying our fathers.  <i>Le
Juste!</i>&quot; he repeated with bitter scorn, &quot;<i>Le Juste!</i> A man who had a
hundred virtues that became a valet--witness his love for shaving his courtiers,
for larding his own fillets of veal, for combing his  <i>mignon's</i> wigs--and
not one that became a master, a king, except dissimulation! My God! he had that
royal gift, at least. You know what he and that devil incarnate, Richelieu, did
here in the south, did at Rochelle?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know,&quot; Martin replied. &quot;Alas! all the world knows. Yet it
must have been after his time that Cyprien de Beauvilliers, as he then was, came
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If he came,&quot; said Cavalier, &quot;he came under another guise, a
mask; under another name. And it is long ago; you will never find him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I fear not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Moreover, even should you do so, of what avail to you, to
him? Will Louis disgorge the de Rochebazon wealth, will the Church of Rome
release one dernier of what she has clutched? Monsieur, you have flung your
fortune away for a shadow, a chimera, since you yourself will never get it now.
Better have taken it, have got back to your own land, have enjoyed it in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would have been treachery to the dead--to her who believed
in me and died deeming that I was a true child of her own faith. And,&quot; he added,
&quot;she was a good woman in spite of that faith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Cavalier glanced at him, then shrugged his shoulders. Yet as
he turned away he muttered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I begin to understand why your country is so great, so
prosperous. Understand! if all Englishmen are like you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">That conversation was not to end thus, however, with a
delicate compliment to Martin's honour, since, ere Cavalier had strode many
paces from him, he came back and, taking a seat by his side in the great cavern
where they then were, began to talk to him about the future hopes of the
Protestant cause, in Languedoc especially. &quot;We shall win,&quot; he said, &quot;we shall
win! What we want, which after all is not much for Louis to grant, we must have:
Freedom to worship as we choose, freedom from paying taxes for a Church we have
revolted from, freedom to come and go out of France as we desire. Let Louis
grant that and I will place at his disposal so fine a regiment that none of his
dragoons or  <i>chevaux-légers</i> shall be our superiors. None! He shall say to
me what he said to Jean Bart, the sailor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What did he say to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He sent for Jean Bart one day at Versailles, received him
among all his grinning, shoulder-shrugging courtiers, and, looking on Jean and
his rough, simple comrades, said, 'Bart,  <i>mon ami</i>, you have done more for
me than all my admirals.' And I love Bart for his reply when, casting his eyes
round on all the admirals and captains who stood in the throng, he answered, '<i>Mon
Dieu! je crois bien</i>. Without doubt! That is, if these  <i>petits crevés</i>
are your admirals and captains.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Martin smiled at the little story, then he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I would to God your cause, my own faith, could prosper here.
We have gone through much stress ourselves to make it secure and safe in
England. Discarded our king, who was of the family more dearly loved in England
than any that have ever sat on her throne, yet we were forced to do it. But the
Protestants of England can make a stronger boast than those of your land,
Monsieur Cavalier. They alone have suffered; they never retaliated as you have
done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As we were forced to retaliate,&quot; he exclaimed, striking the
table in his excitement. &quot;My God! think of what we have suffered. And not our
men alone, but our wives, our sisters, our old mothers. Have you ever seen a
gray-haired woman stripped and beaten in a market place? Have you ever seen a
young innocent girl stretched naked on a wheel, the shame of her exposure even
more frightful than the blows of  <i>la massue?</i> Have you ever stood on board
a galley laden with Protestant slaves or smelled the burning flesh of old men at
the stake? We have, we of these mountain deserts, and--and--my God!&quot; while even
as he spoke he wept, brushing the tears from his eyes fiercely, &quot;I wonder that
that girl, Urbaine Ducaire, is still alive, Protestant though she be. Wonder she
is spared, since she is the loved treasure of that tiger, Baville.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Protestant though she be!&quot; Martin repeated. &quot;You know that?
From some surer source than the divinations, the revelations of La Grande
Marie?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know it,&quot; Cavalier said, facing round suddenly on him, &quot;I
know it now for certain. Ducaire was a Protestant living at Mont Joyre. I have
discovered all. And I curse the discovery! For otherwise we would have repaid
Baville a thousandfold for all his crimes, wrung his heartstrings as he has
wrung ours for years, slaughtered his pet lamb as he has slaughtered hundreds of
ours. But she is a Protestant, therefore safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When will you release her, let her return to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ho!  <i>la, la!</i>&quot; the other replied. &quot;That must be thought
upon. Even now she is a great hostage in our hands, a card that may win the
trick. And--and--you and she are very intimate; yet can I tell you something
without fear of its being repeated to her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will respect any confidence you place in me so long as it
thrusts not against her welfare.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will not do that. Yet listen. Ere she leaves us there is
something to be told her as regards Baville's friendship for her father,
Ducaire. And, when she has heard that, it may be she will never wish to return
to him, to set eyes on her beloved Intendant again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God! What is to become of her then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For reply Cavalier only laughed. Then he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is always a home for any Protestant here, and she can
not complain of how we have treated her. I think myself she will elect to stay
with us, unless----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Unless?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Something more tempting offers,&quot; and again he laughed. &quot;She
might, monsieur will understand, fall in love. With--say--some hero.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment Martin wondered if Cavalier alluded to himself;
in another he  <i>knew</i> that he did so. There was no mistaking the glance in
the Camisard's eyes. But he gave him no opportunity of saying anything further
on the subject, asking instead if he might be confided in with regard to the
strange story which, when told to Urbaine, was to quench every spark of love and
affection in her heart for Baville, the man who, with all his faults, had
cherished and loved her so fondly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, monsieur,&quot; Cavalier replied. &quot;That can not be--as yet.
Later you will doubtless know all, know the reason why Urbaine Ducaire should
change her love for him to an undying hate. Meanwhile I have to ask a favour of
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A favour? What is there in my power to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This: The power to help us end this war--you, a Protestant,
an Englishman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can not understand. God knows I desire nothing better.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Soit!</i> Then aid us. Thus: The English agent is at
Nîmes, disguised. He passes under the name of Flottard, and has plans for the
use of your admiral, who will bring his fleet to Cette or Toulon when the time
is ripe. Unfortunately, however, this man, this  <i>soi-disant</i>
Flottard, has not the French very clearly. As for us--poor weavers, carders,
husbandmen--what should we know of other tongues? We can not speak a word of
your language. Monsieur Martin, you are a Protestant, an Englishman. Before God
I think you English the greatest of all. Help us, help us to be free without
more bloodshed, to worship the Almighty as we see fit, to bow our necks no more
before the Scourge of God. Help us! Help us!&quot; he repeated, &quot;us of your own
faith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Stirred to the heart's core by the man's appeal, though he
scarce needed such impulse, every fibre in him, every drop of blood in his
veins, tingling for those of his own faith, of his own loved religion, he
answered quietly, saying again:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What I can do I will,&quot; and adding, also quietly, &quot;or die in
the attempt.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_22" href="#div1Ref_22">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h4>

<h5>I LOVE YOU.</h5>

<p class="normal">Urbaine and Martin sat together on that night which followed
the sunny afternoon when they had been alone together on the promontory, in one
of the smaller caverns that opened out of the large one--a cavern which, of
late, Cavalier had used as that in which they ate their meals--Roland, who
shared with him the position of chief of the Camisards (and indeed claimed to be
the absolute chief), being rarely in this part of the mountains. To-night,
however, Cavalier was absent too, he having gone on one of those terribly
dangerous visits to the valleys which he periodically made, sometimes to spy
into what the following of Baville were doing, or what the king's troops; or to
head some sanguinary raid upon a place where arms or ammunition, food or
clothes, were likely to be obtained.</p>

<p class="normal">But to-night he had gone forth on a different mission: to
precede Martin on his way to Nîmes, to see if all the mountain passes were free
of their enemies and, should such be the case, to conduct him into the city,
there to have an interview with the English agent.</p>

<p class="normal">Therefore Urbaine and Martin were alone together, save for the
Camisard woman who waited upon them at their meal, and who did not obtrude
herself more than was necessary into the cavern they were in.</p>

<p class="normal">As with the larger one and with those which each of them used
as their sleeping apartment, its furnishing and surroundings would have created
intense astonishment to any of the outside world who should have been able to
observe it. Hung with skins in some places, with rich and costly tapestry and
arras in others, all of which were the results of successful forays upon
châteaux and  <i>manoirs</i> which, a few hours after the raids, were nothing
but smoking ruins, the onlooker might well have believed that, instead of a
natural vault originally fashioned by Nature's own hands, he stood within the
hall of some ancient feudal castle, such as the De Rohans or the Ruvignys had
once possessed in the vicinity. Also he might have thought that the table at
which those two sat was one prepared for the reception of guests at Versailles.</p>

<p class="normal">A table covered with the whitest napery, on which sparkled
many pieces of the prized  <i>vaisselles</i> of the  <i>noblesse</i> and the  <i>
haut-monde</i>, so prized, indeed, that laws and edicts had been passed
preventing the sale of such things or their transposition from one family to
another; adorned as well with  <i>verres-fins</i>, and with silver-handled
knives and silver forks. Also for provisions there were upon this table a
<i>poularde</i> and the remains of a choice ham, a bottle of Ginestoux and
another of Lunel, a silver basketful of delicate, white chipped bread, and a
crystal bowl of mountain fruit. Yet the glass and the silver bore no two crests
alike. The arms that were broidered on the napery represented still a third
family. All was spoil torn from half a dozen ruined and sacked mansions.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I pray God, mademoiselle,&quot; Martin said, after having in vain
pressed his companion to eat more than the shred of  <i>poularde</i> she had
trifled with, and to drink at least one glass of the Ginestoux, &quot;that this task
on which I go may end all your grief. You know that Cavalier promises on my
return, our object accomplished, to allow me to take you away from here, to
return you in safety to your father's--to M. Baville's arms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered, looking up at him, &quot;yes, to return me to
my father's arms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will pray, therefore, for my success? It means all you
can most desire, all that you can hope for till these troubles are past. Once
back in his house, no further harm can come near you; you are safe with him.
Nay, even though he were in danger through any further success of theirs, you
are still safe. They deem you one of themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will pray,&quot; she said, &quot;for your success, your prosperity,
now and forever--for all that you may undertake. Yet--yet--do you know?--I have
almost ceased to pray at all now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, oh, God forbid!&quot; he exclaimed, his heart wrung by her
words.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To whom am I to pray? What am I, how am I to approach Him? If
I am a Protestant I must pray for his, my father's, downfall; if a Catholic, for
the destruction of what I----&quot; She did not finish her sentence, but added
instead: &quot;Best never utter prayer at all; forget that from my childhood I have
been taught to worship humbly and to never know a petition unheard. Oh,&quot; she
said, thrusting her hands through the great coils of golden hair that adorned
her head, &quot;oh, that I had died on the day you saved my life, that the bullet
which pierced my poor
<i>gouvernante's</i> breast had found mine instead!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Profoundly touched, moved to the deepest pity and sympathy by
her words--the words of one so young and fair, yet, alas! so distraught--he
moved nearer to her and, unaware even, perhaps, of his action, took her hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why,&quot; he said, speaking very low, yet with a voice that
seemed as music in her ears, &quot;why feel thus, suffer thus? In spite of all the
dissensions between our faiths--grant even that you are no Protestant--we
worship the same God though we see him with different eyes. Urbaine,&quot; he
whispered, forgetting as he spoke that he had broken down the barrier of
formality which had been between them until now, &quot;if you can not pray for me
to-night, can not pray that my efforts may meet with success, how can I depart
and leave you here? How go, knowing that your heart is not with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not with you?&quot; she whispered in her turn. &quot;Not with you?
Alas----&quot; and again broke off, saying no more.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Urbaine,&quot; he continued, emboldened now to repeat softly her
name, and perhaps not understanding her repetition of his words, deeming, it may
be, that the repetition confirmed them, &quot;Urbaine, your heart, your wishes must
go with me, with the cause I undertake. It is the cause of peace and
reconciliation, of strengthening your king's hands by winning back his subjects
to him. For if this fleet can but get a foothold for its men on shore, Louis
must make terms with all who are now beating him down; not only in this fair
Languedoc, but over all Europe a lasting peace may ensue. A peace,&quot; he
continued, still gently yet impressively, &quot;between your land and mine. Yours and
mine,&quot; he repeated, dwelling, it seemed to her, pleasantly on the coupling of
their interests together--&quot;yours and mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For answer she only sighed, then she said a moment later:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet to go on this mission may mean death to you. If Montrevel
or Julien caught you--O God! it sickens me to think of your peril. They might
not know, might not even believe, all that you have done for me. The end would
be awful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet remember also that they would not know, can not know,
that I am a Protestant--worse than all else within their eyes, an Englishman.
And, not knowing, nothing would be suspected.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still I fear,&quot; she answered. &quot;Am overcome with horror and
anxiety. Oh!&quot; she exclaimed again, &quot;oh! if your reward for your noble chivalry
to me should be nothing but disaster. If--if we should never meet again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fear not,&quot; he said. &quot;We shall meet again. I know it; it is
borne in upon me. We shall meet again. I shall restore you to your father's
arms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, even as he spoke, he remembered the words that Cavalier
had uttered under the seal of confidence, the words: &quot;When she has heard what is
to be told, it may be she will never seek to return to him, to set eyes on her
beloved Intendant again.&quot; Remembered them and wondered what they might portend.</p>

<p class="normal">As he did so there came into the cavern one of the Camisards,
a man who had been deputed to lead him at a given time to where Cavalier was to
await his coming. A guide who said briefly that the horses were prepared and
ready to set forth at monsieur's pleasure, then went outside to wait for him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Farewell, Urbaine,&quot; Martin said. &quot;Adieu. Nay, do not weep.
All will, all must be, well with you, otherwise I would not leave you. And,
remember, once my task is accomplished you are free. It is for that, as for
other things, in other hopes, that I go. Bid me Godspeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It seemed, however, as if she could not let him depart.
Weeping, she clung to his arm, her cheeks bedashed with the tears that ran down
them, her hands clasping his. And then, overmastered by her misery, he said that
to her which he had never meant to say until, at least, happier days had dawned
for both--if, as he sometimes thought, he should ever dare to say it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Urbaine,&quot; he whispered, &quot;Urbaine, be brave; take heart; pray
for me. Listen, hear my last words ere I go. I love you--have loved you since
that night we sat beneath the acacias after I had saved you. I shall love you
ever--till I die.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">The moon shone out through deep inky clouds that scurried
swiftly beneath her face as Martin and the guide set forth to descend to the
spot where Cavalier was to await them. Up here there were no precautions
necessary to be taken, since to the higher portions of the Cévennes it was
impossible that any enemy could have penetrated from below. The paths that led
up to the caves which formed the barracks and dwelling places of the two
thousand men who now kept all Languedoc in dread and two of Louis' armies at
check were of so narrow and impassable a nature that Thermopylæ itself might
have acknowledged them as worthy rivals; and, even had they been less close and
tortuous, were so guarded at intervals by pickets of Camisards that none could
have surmounted them. Also in many places the route had been made to pass
specially over terrible chasms and ravines, since, by so doing, it enabled the
defenders of the passes to construct drawbridges which could be lowered or
raised at their own pleasure, or, in case of necessity, destroyed altogether.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet one precaution had been taken for their journey--a
precaution never neglected by those dwellers of the mountains, in case they were
forced to take to flight and desired to leave no trace behind them--their
animals were shod  <i>backward</i> on their fore feet, a method which, in
conjunction with the usual shoeing of the hind feet, was almost certain to
baffle those who should endeavour to follow their tracks.</p>

<p class="normal">Beneath that moon which shone fitfully from the deep masses of
rain-charged clouds the two men paced in Indian file down the narrow passes,
seeing as they went that which, for now many weeks, had been visible to all eyes
in the province--namely, the flames of villages on fire at different points of
the compass; hearing, too, as they were borne on the winds, the distant ringing
of alarm bells and tocsins from many a beleaguered church and monastery. For not
only did those flames spring from edifices wherein the old faith was still
maintained, but also from the villages and hamlets where some Protestants
continued to dwell and worship in their own manner, hoping ever for better,
happier days. Already it was calculated that more than forty Romish churches had
been destroyed, with, in many cases, the bourgs in which they stood; ere all was
over the number was doubled. And already, also, more than that number of
Protestant places of worship, with the villages around them, had been pillaged,
sacked, and burned by Montrevel and Julien, while, in their case, ere all was
over the number was almost trebled.</p>

<p class="normal">Thinking of his newly declared love for Urbaine, thinking,
too, of how, in whispered words, she had declared her love for him in return, of
how in their last hasty embrace, which had been also their first, they had sworn
deathless fidelity to each other, Martin took but little heed of those midnight
sights telling of happy homes ruined forever which he had now been forced so
often to gaze upon from the heights where the Camisards dwelt. He had grown
accustomed to these beacons of horror, in spite of the unhappiness they caused
him.</p>

<p class="normal">But now he saw a new phase of stern justice and punishment at
which he could not fail to shudder.</p>

<p class="normal">High up upon three gibbets at the wayside by which they
passed--gibbets so placed that, when their ghastly burdens should rot from the
chains which held them now, they would fall down and down until they reached the
bottom of the ravine a thousand feet below--there hung three corpses; swung
waving to the mountain air, while ever and anon upon their white but
blood-stained faces the moon glinted now and again, making those faces look as
though they perspired in her rays, were clammy with sweat. And two grinned
hideously in those rays, a bullet wound which had shattered the mouth of one
giving to his face the appearance of a man convulsed with laughter, while the
smirk of the other face was, in truth, the last grimace of the death agony. The
features of the third told naught, since, from a wound in his forehead, there
had run out the blood which was now caked and hardened to a mask, hiding all
below.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God!&quot; exclaimed Martin, with a shiver, &quot;who are they? Men
caught here and executed as spys, troopers made prisoners and done to death by
the avengers?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay,&quot; replied the man, while he made a contemptuous gesture
at the loathsome things that at the moment executed a weird fantastic movement
in unison as a fresh gust of wind swept down from the mountains above, making
them sway and dance to its cold breath, &quot;nay, vagabonds,  <i>marauds</i>.
Murderers these, not soldiers. Those men are of our number--were of our
number--Protestants--ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What, traitors?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, traitors--to humanity. Listen! They caught one, a good
woman, Madame de Miramand, a Papist, yet a kindly creature who succoured all
alike. Also she was young, not twenty, and beautiful. She was  <i>en voyage</i>&quot;--again
Martin shuddered, thinking of another woman young and beautiful who had also
been  <i>en voyage</i>, and almost caught--&quot;had with her her jewels, also her  <i>
vaisselles</i>. Well they slew her even as she knelt before them, stabbed her,
left her to die, left her thus as she prayed God to pardon them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go on,&quot; Martin said, seeing that he paused.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God may pardon them,&quot; the guide said. &quot;One, however, would
not. Cavalier! We caught them, tried them; you see the sentence. It is not women  <i>
we</i> war upon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he finished, again the loathsome figures swung to the
breeze, again they danced and pirouetted in their chains, while from behind a
rock Cavalier himself strode forward.</p>

<p class="normal">It was the spot that had been the meeting place appointed with
the guide.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is true,&quot; he said. &quot;We war not with women. Let Montrevel
or Julien do that. Or their master--Louis!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_23" href="#div1Ref_23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;LOVE HER! BEYOND ALL THOUGHT! AND SHE IS THERE.&quot;</h5>

<p class="normal">With the rapidity of wildfire the news had run over all
Languedoc at this time--was known, too, and shared by Catholics as well as
Protestants--that the English, who once they drew the sword never sheathed it
until its work was done, meditated an attack on France in a fresh place, that
place being her Mediterranean seaboard, the one spot still free from their
assaults up to now, also a spot more vulnerable, since there were scarce any
troops to defend it, the armies of Montrevel and Julien being sufficiently
occupied in endeavouring, without success, to prevent the terrible reprisals the
Camisards were at last making.</p>

<p class="normal">And now indeed the desolation of Languedoc was supreme; now,
like a torch that flareth in the night, was visible an awful terror upon all of
the old faith, as well as the adherents of Louis, who dwelt therein. Men of that
old faith barricaded themselves in their houses, refusing to either quit them or
let any of their families do so, or to receive bread into those houses in any
other way than by baskets raised by cords, either for fear that they should be
stabbed to the heart on their doorsteps or that they should add one more body to
the many that hung upon the branches of the trees by the wayside--bodies having
affixed to their dead breasts the label bearing the words, &quot;<i>Tous qui
tomberont entre les mains des vengeurs seront traités ainsi</i>.&quot; Verily,
Languedoc was, as its greatest churchman, Fléchier, said, but one vast gaping
wound!</p>

<p class="normal">Yet not only was it the avengers who caused the wound.
Maddened by defeat, by merciless retaliation on their enemies' part, by their
fierce determination to never give or ask for quarter, Baville, Montrevel, and
Julien enacted more awful cruelties than had ever yet been practised upon those
of the Reformed faith. Again the dungeons of the prisons, the vaults of the
cathedrals, which living prisoners shared with the coffined dead, re-echoed with
the groans of the former;
<i>les places publiques</i> were foul with the odour of burning flesh and of
corpses that rotted on wheels; the very roofs were laden with carrion birds
waiting their opportunity to swoop down and plunge their beaks into the dying;
even mothers slew the babes in their arms sooner than see them perish slowly
before their eyes from the pangs of thirst and hunger. But still the war went
on, if such oppression, such retaliation, could be dignified by the name of war.
Went on because from Paris the word still came that none should worship God in
their own way, or in any other method than the priests of Rome directed--priests
who declared with their lips that the God they served was one of love and mercy,
yet sowed with full hands the seeds of violence and trouble, of blood and death.</p>

<p class="normal">And now to add to all the terrors that the papists felt at
last, to all the fierce joys that the Protestants had begun to thrill with, it
was rumoured through the country that some great admiral of the accursed English
race, backed up by the Duke of Savoy, was about to land an army at one of the
ports with the full intention of assisting the Protestants, and of, so those
papists said, establishing Protestantism over all the land. No wonder,
therefore, that the priests fled from their churches, that the archbishop said
(forgetting how he and his had outraged God for years) that &quot;God had deserted
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Clad like muleteers in some cases, in others like travelling
weavers, and in still others like husbandmen and horse-dealers, some scores of
Camisards were making their ways by ones and twos at this period toward Cette,
avoiding Montpellier and leaving it to the east of them, and threading the low
lands that lay between that diocese and the sister one of D'Agde, for  <i>they</i>
knew where the landing was to be attempted; knew likewise when the English
assistance was to be expected. Also--though few were aware of it, and Baville
alone, on his side, suspected that such was the case--from Holland, from Geneva,
from the villages of the Vaud and Valais, from Canterbury and Spitalfields were
coming refugees, some making their way by foot and some on horses. They had been
summoned from the lands they had fled to, summoned to return and take part in
what was now to be done.</p>

<p class="normal">Amid a small band which at this moment drew near to Frontignan
there rode Martin Ashurst, his companions being some of the noblest Protestant
blood of the province. Also by his side there rode the English agent known as
Flottard, a Huguenot whose father had escaped long since into England and who
spoke that language better than his own, or rather than the  <i>langue d'oc</i>
which had been his father's.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And now,  <i>mes frères</i>,&quot; said one of these companions,
Ulson de la Valette, who as a boy had been forced to stand before the scaffold
of Greonble holding his fainting mother's hand while they witnessed the
decapitation of his elder brother  <i>pour cause d'hérésie</i>, &quot;we must
separate, to meet again by Heaven's grace as followers of the English admiral.
Monsieur, read the route to our friends,&quot; and he turned to a man clad as a monk.
He had in truth been one who had but recently been unfrocked at Rome on
suspicion of heretic principles, and had now openly avowed Protestantism, while
still retaining the gown as a disguise.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This is the route,&quot; the monk answered, producing from his
breast a paper which, in the clear light of the dawn, he read from. &quot;You, De la
Valette, and you, Fontanes, will pass straight on to Frontignan. You,
<i>messieurs les Anglais</i>,&quot; and he glanced at Martin and Flottard, &quot;will
proceed through La Susc; the rest must distribute themselves and travel through
the villages of Sainte Bréze, Collanze, and Le Test. Yet, remember, Baville has
warned every  <i>aguet</i>, every watchman, every village consul and river
guard. Capture and discovery mean death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The meeting-place,&quot; said Ulson de la Valette, &quot;of all of us
is the plain of Frontignan, 'twixt that and the great port. The signal will be
the landing of the first English troops, the entry of the first ship of war. The
password is 'God and his children.' My friends, farewell; yet, as you ride,
forget not to pray for success. If God is on our side now we are avenged and
Louis beaten down under our feet. We shall triumph.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later all had parted, dispersing quietly after a
hand-shake round, and each going alone, Martin and Flottard remaining behind for
some little while so as not to follow too hurriedly upon the footsteps of the
others.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet,&quot; said Flottard in English, which he spoke like a native,
&quot;we must part too, Monsieur Martin. I have to enter Bouziques if I can; 'tis
full of disguised Savoyards and some of your--our--land. You will, I should
suppose, join Sir Cloudesley Shovel?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As agent,&quot; Martin replied, &quot;not combatant. My mission is to
lead his troops if possible to Montpellier and Nîmes, to act as guide.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will not save your neck if you are caught,&quot; Flottard said
with a laugh.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is no thought of that,&quot; Martin answered, hurt and
annoyed that the man should suppose this was his consideration. &quot;But--but--I
have other things to do. To me are to be confided the arms, ammunition, and
money which the English fleet brings. Also, with the exception of you and me,
there is no one who can speak English.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And,&quot; repeated Flottard, &quot;there is no one the French will
punish as ferociously as they will punish us--for I am English too now--if we
are caught.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They can do no worse by us than by their own,&quot; Martin replied
quietly.</p>

<p class="normal">Afterward, when they had parted, Flottard taking his way to
Bouzique while Martin rode on quietly toward Cette, he, musing deeply on all
which might be the outcome of the proposed attack by the English admiral, told
himself that, even were it possible for his punishment to be made five thousand
times worse than anything which had ever been dealt out to the Protestants,
nothing should stop him now but death. He loved Urbaine Ducaire; had loved her,
as he had said, since first he saved her life, since they had sat together
beneath the sweet-scented blossoms of the acacia trees on that soft summer night
amid the desolation of the land; he should love her till the end. And--and
Cavalier had promised that, if he helped their cause now, on his return he
should lead Urbaine forth a free woman; should return her safe and unharmed to
Baville's arms, even though Baville was the most hated name the Camisards knew.</p>

<p class="normal">Cavalier would keep his word. That he never doubted. Only
there was the future to be thought upon--the afterward. His love for her and
hers for him. How was that love ever to be brought to a happy fruition? How?
How? How? Would Baville give her to him, a Protestant, even though it were
proved, as Cavalier had said it could now be proved beyond all doubt, that
Urbaine was herself born in that faith? Give her to him, an Englishman, a native
of the land which had wrought much disaster on France through innumerable
centuries, that was even now closing its grasp of steel upon France and crushing
the very life-blood out of all its pores? Would Baville, the Tiger of Languedoc,
ever consent to such a union as they projected, the fulfilment of the troth
which they had plighted?</p>

<p class="normal">One hope there was, he reflected: a hope that at least the
question of faith might not prove an insurmountable object. For though Baville
was of the old faith, though in the name of that faith and at the instigation of
its chiefs he had wrought innumerable cruelties, had broken countless hearts and
driven thousands to despair, religion had been but a war cry with him, a banner
under which to march. As a papist he was but an indifferent one. He had said,
had owned as much more than once, that it was duty which led him to be severe,
to crush down rebellion, to exalt the King's authority. He would have acted in
precisely the same manner as he had recently acted had France been Protestant
and had the  <i>attroupés</i> been papists. &quot;<i>Il est plus royaliste que le
Roi!</i>&quot; Urbaine had said of him once in speaking to Martin; &quot;and to him the
soil of France and the power of Louis are the most sacred things he knows,
except one other, his duty. The King made him governor of Languedoc; in his mind
Languedoc exists for the King alone. Forgive him all for his loyalty, his
obedience to duty.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he reflected on this, trying to pierce the future,
endeavouring to see one glimmering ray of hope amid all the darkness which
enveloped that future, he drew near to where the port of Cette was; in the warm
autumn air with which these southern plains were suffused, it seemed almost as
if he scented the breezes of the great blue sea beyond. Also it seemed as if
already the balm of the myriad flowers which adorn its shores was surrounding
him, as if, with the bright rays of the sun, a promise was heralded of peace and
happiness at last.</p>

<p class="normal">It behooved him to be careful how he progressed, for all the
countryside was in a state of alarm. The English fleet had been seen out at sea
two days before! Also it was known to all the King's followers that a descent
was intended, while a regiment of dragoons marching swiftly to the coast had
given the information that, from the towers of the cathedral at Montpellier,
that fleet had been seen approaching Maqualone. While even a worse cause for
alarm was the rumour that Cavalier with six hundred Camisards had passed by a
circuitous route toward Cette, and was now waiting on the beach to welcome the
English invaders.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, furnished with papers which Flottard had caused to be
procured from Paris, not only Martin but most of the refugees who had of late
returned to the south of France managed to reach the coast ere night fell, to
reach the shore, there to await the coming of those who were to land and succour
them--a shore upon which were those Camisards who, setting out with Cavalier
long after Martin had departed, had by a forced march contrived to reach Cette
ere he and his companions were able to do so, owing to the  <i>détours</i> they
had made; a sandy, shingly beach, from which, as now the warm night closed in on
them, all gazed upon what they saw before them.</p>

<p class="normal">Two large ships of war (their names were afterward known to be
the Pembroke and the Tartar) which through that night made signals frequently
that, none understanding, remained unanswered. Signals arranged by the Earl of
Nottingham (who, after many compunctions against assisting rebels in arms, even
though in arms against a king hostile to England, had consented to Shovel making
the attack), the key to which he had forwarded to Peytaud, a Protestant but
recently returned from Holland. But Peytaud had been caught that morning ere he
could reach Cette; the signals had been found upon him, and, at the time that
the Pembroke and the Tartar were showing their masthead lights, the unfortunate
man's body was lying broken all to pieces on a wheel in the crossroads outside
Aiguësmortes.</p>

<p class="normal">And there were no duplicates! The signals remained unanswered.
Later on Cavalier said that he did not know these were the ships of war, but in
the darkness took them to be fishermen's boats. Had he known, he averred that he
would have swam out to them rather than have missed so great a chance.</p>

<p class="normal">In the morning when day broke the topsails of these vessels
were seen to fill. Soon they were gone.</p>

<p class="normal">The hoped-for chance was lost, and lost forever. The tide no
longer served; nothing could have been then landed from the English ships, nor
could they have remained where they were. Already the galleys armed to the teeth
had put out in dozens to attack them. On the horizon there rose the topmasts of
a great French fleet coming swiftly from Toulon.</p>

<p class="normal">And by Martin's side upon the desolate shore stood Cavalier,
the picture of despair.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The opportunity is gone,&quot; he said; &quot;gone also our last chance
for making peace. It is war now to the end. Yet had your countrymen but got
ashore the struggle would have been over; hampered on all sides, Louis must have
yielded, have made terms. God help us all!&quot; and he turned away to bid his
followers disperse and make their way back by the routes and by-paths which they
knew of to the mountains.</p>

<p class="normal">As he did so there came through the crowd of Camisards one
whom Martin had seen before, a gaunt, haggard man, with an arm missing--an arm
which, it was said, had withered under the cruelties the Abbé du Chaila had
practised on this Cévenole while he had him in his power at Montvert, so that,
when at last the man was freed, it had to be removed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Cavalier,&quot; he said, &quot;Cavalier, friend and leader, bid them
also hasten on their way; lose no time. You have heard the news?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No! What?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Montrevel and Julien have forced the passes, taking advantage
of our absence. Roland, too, is away. The caverns are besieged. All in them are
lost.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lost! Pshaw! They will stand a siege of all Louis' armies.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, they will. But it is not for siege that the  <i>battue</i>
is arranged. Those in the caverns are caught in a  <i>blocus</i>; they can make
no
<i>sortie</i>. Outside, fires have been made. Hurry! or you will find nothing
but smoke-dried corpses when you return.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke there fell upon his ears a heartbroken gasp.
Turning his eyes, they lighted upon Martin--Martin who, white to the lips and
palsied with horror, could only mutter, &quot;Urbaine! Urbaine. And she is there!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay!&quot; said Cavalier fiercely, &quot;she is there. The blow falls as
heavily on Baville as on us----&quot; Then paused in his speech. Paused to say in an
altered, gentle tone a moment later to Martin, &quot;I see! See all! You love her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Love her! My God,&quot; Martin replied, &quot;beyond all thought! And
she is there!&quot;</p>
<br>

<h5>&quot;AN ERRAND OF LIFE OR DEATH.&quot;</h5>

<p class="normal">Through the fair, sweet land known as the  <i>Département
Hérault</i> Martin rode north, toward where the mountains lay, in the darkness
of the autumn night, like purple shadows hovering over the earth; rode
recklessly, as though caring little whether he or the horse he bestrode found
death at the next step. Recklessly, as it seemed to the startled shepherds
guarding their flocks of Narbonne sheep in their huts of reeds and clay, and
peering out as the horseman dashed by, the moon illuminating his pale face so
that, but for the clatter of the creature's hoofs, they would scarcely have
known whether 'twas a spectre or a living thing which flew past. Recklessly,
too, as it seemed to peasants sleeping in their cottages, and aroused by that
clatter only to turn on their beds and sleep again. Recklessly, threateningly,
as perhaps it may have seemed to startled fawns and timorous hares and rabbits,
fleeing helter-skelter into vineyards where grew the luscious Lunel and
Genistoux grapes, or into underbush where lurked the famed and dreaded viper of
the south.</p>

<p class="normal">But reckless as that hurried course might seem, wild and
furious as the ride of Gary from London to Edinburgh, to tell James that the
great Queen was dead and he was King of England as well as of Scotland, it was
not so in truth, and, though swift and unhalting, was neither foolhardy nor
rashly impetuous. He was too good a horseman, also too kindly-hearted a man, to
spur a willing beast above its best endeavours. Yet he knew well enough that
beyond breathing spells in cool copses, where the moon flung down on to the
thick grass the shadowy lacery of leaves which quivered in the night breezes,
and beyond halts at trickling rivulets so that the panting creature might drink
and be refreshed, there must be no delay. None if he would reach Montrevel or
Julien ere the worst had fallen; if he would be in time to tell them that, amid
those whom they sought to murder and burn in the caves they had surrounded, was
the fairest woman in all Languedoc, the child of Baville's heart, Urbaine
Ducaire.</p>

<p class="normal">Also he knew the dangers that lurked in his path; knew how,
all along the road he went, were countless soldiers out seeking for  <i>
attroupés</i>; men who, not knowing what his mission was and perceiving that he
bore no signs about him of royal scarlet, or lace, or accoutrements, would send
a dozen bullets at his back, any one of which would hurl him from his saddle to
the ground a corpse. Nay, once such had almost been the case. Refusing to halt
at the village of St. Jean le Bon, from a tavern had come a shower of such
missiles, which, by God's mercy, had only hissed harmlessly past, though by the
shock he felt beneath him he knew that his saddle had been struck.</p>

<p class="normal">The dawn was nigh as at last he neared Lunel. He knew it by
the deeper chill of the air, by the changing lividness of the summits of the
distant mountains, and by the vanishing of the purple darkness from their caps
and spurs and ridges. If the horse he rode could reach that town he might get a
change of animal and so ride on and on, and on again, until he was within the
outlines of Montrevel and Julien.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Away!&quot; Cavalier had said to him as, after weary waiting, the
evening fell over Cette and he was free at last to commence his journey. All day
he had fretted and stormed at having to remain until the night came, though
forced to do so, since to have started on that wild ride by daylight would have
been, in the state of the locality, simply to invite destruction. &quot;Away! God
grant you may be in time! If they spare her they must spare the others, as, if
they slay them, they must slay her. And--and--we shall be close behind you. If
Montrevel and Julien have got into our mountains, may the devil, their master,
help them! They will never get out again; we have them in a trap.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And he laughed bitterly while repeating aloud the word &quot;Away!&quot;
Also he added, &quot;If you can but induce them to hold their hands for twenty-four
hours we will do the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Lunel came nearer and nearer now. He thanked God again and
again that still the horse beneath him did not falter, still swept on in an
even, easy stride. Already he could see in the morning air, now clear and
bright, the great wooden spire of its church, which up to now had escaped
destruction. And he remembered how Cavalier had told him to have no fear in
entering it, since neither papists nor Protestants had made any attack upon it
because it was principally inhabited by Jews from Marseilles, who, from the days
of Philip of Valois, had been permitted to dwell within it, they taking, as was
natural, no share in the troubles with which the province was torn.</p>

<p class="normal">Nearer and nearer, close now, its one peaked,  <i>calotte</i>-roofed
tower, which faced to the south, standing up like an arrow pointing to the sky
in the cool light of the swift advancing dawn.</p>

<p class="normal">Close now, and hammering on the great gray storm-beaten door
of the ramparts, against which for centuries the  <i>mistral</i> and the  <i>
bise</i> had howled and flung themselves on winter nights and days; on which all
through the summer the southern sun had glared. Hammering with pistol-butt and
clenched hand, loud enough to arouse the dead, and calling:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Awake! Open! Open! In God's name open!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Hola!</i>&quot; a voice shouted answeringly from within. &quot;No
more. Cease. I come! 'In God's name.' Good! You give the password. 'Tis well!&quot;
the utterance being mingled with the grating of a key in a lock and the rumbling
of a bar. And Martin divined that by a chance, a miracle, he had uttered the
royalist sign.</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later the gate was open wide. Before it stood a lean,
gray-haired warder, the very counterpart of Cervante's hero, fastening the tags
of his jacket with one hand as he threw back the door with the other.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur rides in haste,&quot; he said, seeing that he had a
gentleman to do with, though no soldier clad in  <i>bleu royal</i> or scarlet,
as he had expected. &quot;What is the news you carry? Have the accursed English
landed, the vile Protestants captured the port?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay,&quot; answered Martin, &quot;but I ride on an errand of life or
death. I must reach Baville; above all, Montrevel or Julien. They know not what
they do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What they do! What is't? I have heard they barricade
themselves in Uzès and Alais, yet thousands strong! Soldiers! Bah! Tosspots and
<i>vauriens</i>, afraid of a beggarly set of goatherds.  <i>Dieu des Dieux!</i>
'twas not so when I rode behind Condé.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are mistaken. They are in the mountains, putting all to
fire and sword. Above all, to fire. And among those whom they will slay--they
know her not--is Baville's child. Friend, as you have loved ones of your own,
help me to a fresh horse. This one is spent.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is,&quot; the warder said, all action now and regarding the
smoking flanks of the poor beast. &quot;Antoine,  <i>petit</i>,&quot; he called, &quot;out of
your bed,  <i>dindon</i>. A bucket of water, quick. And for you, monsieur, a
sup,&quot; whereon he ran into his lodge and came back carrying a great
<i>outre</i>, from out of which he poured a flask of amber-coloured liquor.
&quot;'Tis of the best,&quot; he said, and winked as he did so. &quot;Hein! 'tis Chastelneuf.
Three years in vat. Down with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Another horse, another horse!&quot; Martin exclaimed after he had
swallowed the wine and thanked the man. &quot;In Heaven's name put me in the way of
that. I must on--on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Off!&quot; said the man to a boy who had now come from his lodge,
half dressed, as though he had but just tumbled out of his bed; a boy who was by
now holding a bucket to the horse's thirsty mouth. &quot;Off, Antoine, to the Jew. He
has the cattle. If you have money,&quot; he added to Martin. &quot;Without it you will get
naught from any of his tribe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have enough. Fifty gold pistoles.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Show them not to him, or he will want all. Bargain, traffic,
<i>marchandise</i>. 'Tis the only way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Led by the boy and leading now the steed, with the warder
calling after him that it was strange he had heard naught of what he related,
&quot;for his part, he believed he was misinformed, and that Montrevel and Julien
were doing nothing but eating and drinking up all in the land like locusts,&quot;
Martin went down the street, none of the inhabitants seeming yet awake. It was
as silent and empty as a deserted city.</p>

<p class="normal">In front of a cross in a market place--a cross which the fiery
Anjou had caused to be erected there to remind the Jews of their fathers' sins,
as he said--the boy paused and, pointing to a house with large, capacious
stables by its side, observed:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Tis there that Elie lives. Beat him up, monsieur, beat him
up,&quot; and Martin, following his advice, seized the great copper knocker and
hammered with it as lustily as, some minutes earlier, he had hammered to arouse
the warder.</p>

<p class="normal">Because strange, fantastic thoughts and memories come to us
even in our most bitter moments, so to Martin there came now the thought that
the face, which a moment later appeared at a window above, might well have
served Nokes, the comedian, whom he had often supped with at Pontac's, for a
model of the apothecary in Mantua. A face lean and hatchet-nosed, fleshless
almost as the face of one dying of starvation, the eyes deep sunken above the
beak-like nose.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is't?&quot; this man asked. &quot;What does monsieur desire at
such an hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A horse. A horse at once that will carry me to----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Horses are dear just now. The army needs all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will pay well. Come down and supply me. Quick, every moment
is precious.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So are horses. Yet I will descend. I have a good animal, but
it cost me much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later he appeared at his door, a thick cudgel in his
hand as though to guard against any sudden attack that might be made upon him,
and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The animal I have is worth a hundred gold pistoles.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bah! I have not so much about me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How much have you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Twenty.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Twenty for such an animal! Father of Abraham and Isaac!
Twenty gold pistoles for such a creature!&quot; and he made as though he would
re-enter his house.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let him go, monsieur,&quot; whispered the boy with a grin, &quot;he
will come back.  <i>N'ayez pas peur</i>. Oh!  <i>avec ça</i>, we know him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lad spoke truly, for even as Martin, cursing himself for
trafficking thus at such a moment, resolved to fling his purse of fifty pieces
down before the man and bid him bring out the horse, the Jew's vulpine beak and
pendulous underlip appeared again from behind the door.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will you give twenty-five?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Show me the horse.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A little later, in accordance with some whispered instructions
to another person behind the door, a Jewish maiden was seen leading a horse from
out the stable yard at the side, an animal of an ordinary type, yet looking
sturdy and as though quite capable of carrying Martin to Alais and the mountains
beyond.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Twenty-five?&quot; the Jew asked, leering.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, twenty-five. Help me&quot;--to the boy--&quot;to change saddle and
bridle,&quot; which the lad did willingly enough. But the Hebrew's instincts were
stronger than aught else. As they began to do this he shrieked:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, mother of Moses, the girl is mad. She has brought the
wrong beast. Oh! Oh! Oh! This can not go under fifty pistoles.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is too late to change,&quot; Martin said grimly. &quot;The beast is
mine,&quot; and he produced his purse and told out twenty-five pistoles. Then,
tossing the boy a crown, he said: &quot;Keep my horse for me until I come this way
again or send for it, and I will reward you well. Treat it carefully. Farewell.
The road to Nîmes and Alais? Where is the gate?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The boy indicated it amid the shrieks of the Jew, who now
yelled he was robbed; that he meant twenty-five gold pistoles with the other's
horse thrown in; how else could he part with such an animal for a beggarly
twenty-five? And amid a tussle between the lad on one side and the Abrahamite
and the girl on the other, in which the former seemed quite able to hold his own
and retain his charge, Martin rode down the street to the Nîmes gate.</p>

<p class="normal">Once more he was upon the road. Nearer to his love, to her who
had dawned a star above his life--the woman in deadly peril for whom, as he
tightened rein and pressed flank, he prayed God's mercy. Prayed also that he
might not be too late, not too late.</p>

<p class="normal">The autumn sun beat down upon his head, fierce as July suns in
more northern lands. The skies were like brass. There was no air to fan his
cheek except that which his own swift passage caused. Yet he never felt or
heeded the former, nor missed the latter; there was but one thought in his
mind--Urbaine! Urbaine! Urbaine!</p>

<p class="normal">Lunel was left behind him, had dwindled to a spot. He cursed
the leagues of  <i>détour</i> he had to make to reach Nîmes first, find Baville,
and warn him of the awful danger of the girl if still she lived--oh, God! if
still she lived!--procure his order to those battue-making butchers to hold
their hands, possess himself of it, and hurry on to the mountains, That, that
was all he could do, yet he would accomplish it or reel from his saddle to the
road--dead.</p>

<p class="normal">Through Vergese he went, seeing the cool wooden slopes of Les
Vaquerolles on his left, shouting the password he had by Heaven's grace learned
so opportunely to all who endeavoured to arrest his flight; on, on to Milbaud
and Saint Cesare. And at last Nîmes was ahead of him. He saw it now. The Temple
of Diana rose before his eyes, solitary and majestic as the Romans had left it
two thousand years before; rose, too, beneath the brassy shimmer, the white
marble columns of Agrippa's sons and the city walls.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet also arose something else toward the heavens which
startled, amazed him.</p>

<p class="normal">Stealing up into the yellow haze, a spiral column twined
snakily until it seemed to be merged in the sky, a column white and fleecy at
first, then black at its base, and, later, black up all its length. Next, tinged
flame-colour--soon flame itself. Flame which leaped up in countless tongues as
though with its great flecks and flickers it aspired to lick the canopy above,
flame in which now were mixed black specks and daubs borne up upon its fiery
breath.</p>

<p class="normal">Nîmes was burning. It was impossible to doubt it.</p>

<p class="normal">Set on fire by whom? Camisards descending from the mountains,
or perchance, though that seemed impossible, by Camisards returning from Cette.
Or by the King's forces. Yet, why that? It was the royalist stronghold, the
royalist base. It could scarce be that.</p>

<p class="normal">Spurring his horse, he urged it to its fullest speed through
the last remaining half-league of road running through fields of
crimson-flowered sainfoin and beneath the yellow-green, sweet-scented limes. On,
while now above the broadleaved trees the smoke rose thicker and thicker. On,
scarce knowing why he rode thus or what he had to do in Nîmes except to find
Baville if he were there; to tell him no burning city mattered one jot to him in
comparison with what was doing, might be done by now, up in those mountains five
leagues off which lay bathed in the golden haze of the noontide heat.</p>

<p class="normal">He saw the great southern gate open before him, no warders by
it. Doubtless they were in the city trying to save it from the flames; from the
gate itself he saw people issuing, running. Some--among others two old
gray-haired people, man and woman--wringing their hands; also a great burly  <i>
cordelier</i>, his fat face suffused with an oily smile.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What--what is it?&quot; he cried, reining in his horse. &quot;What
fresh horror now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Murder! Cruelty unparalleled!&quot; the old gray-haired man said,
his look of terror awful to behold. &quot;Wickedness extreme! Montrevel is there,
Julien is there; they have caught the Protestants in the great mill, have barred
them in, they can not escape. And they are burning it. All, all must perish.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Montrevel--Julien--there! It is impossible. They are in the
mountains burning the Protestants  <i>there!</i>&quot; Martin exclaimed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, nay, my son,&quot; the greasy monk exclaimed, chiming in,
&quot;that was but a heaven-inspired ruse to catch the others in the trap. They are
here. They slaughter the heretics,  <i>par le fer et par le feu</i>, as
Montrevel says. Here! Here! My son, make your way in. Join the good work.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_25" href="#div1Ref_25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h4>

<h5>PAR LE FER ET PAR LE FEU.</h5>

<p class="normal">He made his way in.</p>

<p class="normal">Entered by the Porte des Carmes, to find himself in the midst
of a seething mass of people who shouted and gesticulated while pushing each
other to and fro, some doing so in their anxiety to escape from out the city,
others endeavouring to force themselves farther into it and toward the Canal de
la Gau, which was near the gate. A mass of people who seemed infuriated, beyond
the bounds of reason, to frenzy, who shouted and screamed, &quot;<i>Au glaive, au
glaive avec les héritéques</i>. Kill all! Burn all! Now is the time.&quot; While
others shrieked, &quot;To the mill, to the mill!&quot; as onward they went in the
direction of the canal.</p>

<p class="normal">He had put his horse up in a stall behind the gate, tethering
it to a peg alongside one or two other animals which, by their trappings,
evidently belonged to some dragoons; and now, borne on by the crowd, Martin went
the same way, keeping his feet with difficulty yet still progressing,
progressing toward where he saw the flames ascending, darting through dense
masses of black smoke, roaring as a vast furnace roars. Toward the mill that,
all said, was the place which was on fire; the mill in which there were three
hundred people--women, children, and old, decrepit, useless men, old, aged
Protestants who could not take to the mountains--being burned to death; the mill
in which they had been worshipping God in their own fashion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tell me,&quot; Martin besought a bystander, big, brawny, and
muscular, whom he found by his side and who, in spite of his splendidly
developed manhood, wept, dashing the tears fiercely away from his eyes every
moment. &quot;Tell me what has happened. Tell me, I beg you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Murder! Butchery! A crime that will ring down the ages.
Montrevel is burning three hundred helpless ones in Mercier's mill.&quot; Then he
paused, casting his eyes over Martin's riding dress (stained now with the dust
of his long rides) and upon his lace at breast and throat, smirched and dirty
from continued wear. Paused to say: &quot;What are you? a  <i>seigneur</i>, I see.
But of which side? The butchers or the slaughtered?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am of the Reformed faith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of Nîmes?&quot; the man asked. &quot;If so, God help you. Your mother
or your babe may be burning there and you powerless to succour them. Montrevel's
wolves surround the mill. He is there too, mad with wine and lust of blood. If
there is any woman or child you love in Nîmes at this moment, God help you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She whom I love is not here. But, alas! can we do nothing?
You wear a sword as I do? We can strike a blow----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do! What can we do? There are two hundred dragoons there.
What will our blades avail, though we were the best  <i>ferrailleurs</i> in
France?&quot; Then suddenly he cried, &quot;See, there is the slaughter-house!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He spoke truly. The burning mill was before them.</p>

<p class="normal">A sight to freeze one's blood, to turn that blood to ice even
beneath the sky of brass, even before the hot flames that darted forth, licking
up, devouring all.</p>

<p class="normal">It stood, an ancient building of stone foundations and wooden
superstructure. They said the former dated back to Cæsar's day, the latter to
that of Charles le Bel, upon the banks of the canal as it would never stand
again, since now it was nothing but a mass of burning fuel. Also a human
hecatomb, there being within it the ashes of three hundred human beings whose
bodies had that morning been consumed. And Martin blessed God that he had not
been there to hear their piercing shrieks, their cries for mercy and their
supplications.</p>

<p class="normal">Around the nearly destroyed mill, except on one side where it
adjoined an inn, &quot;La Rose de Provence,&quot; the front of which was all singed and
scarred, he saw the executioners, the men who had been soldiers, fierce yet
valiant, until this morning, but who were now worthy of no nobler name than that
of cowardly murderers. Dragoons, Croatian Cravates, now Prance's most bloody
swashbucklers with one exception, the Miquelets, those fierce Pyrenean tigers,
as well as
<i>chevaux-légers</i> and countless numbers of the  <i>milice</i>. And near
them, his sword drawn, his face inflamed with drink and fury, his breast a mass
of ribbons and orders, was Montrevel upon his horse, a scandal to the  <i>bâton</i>
he had lately gained.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Murderer! Assassin! Brave butcher of women and babes,&quot; howled
many in the crowd, one half of which was Protestant, &quot;noble papist! you have
done your work well. Yet beware of Cavalier and Roland!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And even as they so shouted, from more than one window high up
in the roofs there came little puffs of smoke and spits of flame, showing that
he was aimed at. Only the devil protected him. His time was not yet come. He was
mad now with fury or drink, or thirst for human blood. Mad, stung to frenzy by
resistance and contempt, even in spite of all that he had done that morning, of
having glutted his ire on the helpless, which should have sufficed, all heard
him roar:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Finissons!</i> Nîmes is heretic to the core. Make an end
of it.
<i>Avancez, mes soldats</i>. Burn, destroy, slaughter. Kill all.&quot; And he turned
his horse toward where the crowd was thickest and bade the carnage begin,
marshalling his troops into companies the better to distribute them about the
doomed city.</p>

<p class="normal">But now there stepped forth one--Sandricourt, Governor of
Nîmes--who forbade him to do that which he threatened; warned him that if one
more house or street was injured he would himself that night set forth for
Paris, and tell Louis that Montrevel was unworthy of the command he held in this
distracted province.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ha! Sandricourt, 'tis Sandricourt,&quot; whispered one in a knot
of Protestants standing near to where Martin and the man he had accosted were.
&quot;He is the best, he and Fléchier, bishop though he is. If all were like them--if
Baville were--then--then we might live in peace, not see nor know the awful
terrors we have seen this day. Oh, the horror of it! the horror of it!&quot; and he
buried his face in his hands as though to hide some sight that he feared might
blast him.</p>

<p class="normal">Baville! The name recalled the man to Martin's memory. Nay, it
did more, far more than that. Recalled his love, Urbaine. Set him wondering,
too, if by any chance this holocaust had taken place at the Intendant's
suggestion; if this was a vengeance on those who had destroyed her. For he must
deem her dead by now; weeks had passed since she disappeared. Had he set the
shambles fresh running with blood to avenge her loss?</p>

<p class="normal">He must see Baville at once, must tell him she was safe.
Thereby, perhaps, more slaughter might be averted.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where is Baville?&quot; he asked, turning to the group of
terrified Protestants by his side. &quot;Is he in this carnage?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God, he knows,&quot; one replied. &quot;Yet he has not appeared. Not
since this commenced. Were you here at the beginning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, I arrived but now. Is it true, can it be true there are
three hundred destroyed within that?&quot; and he glanced toward the  <i>débris</i>
of the mill, the superstructure now nothing but ashes and charred beams, with,
lying above them, the red tiles of what had been a roof ere it fell in, burying
beneath it--what?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is true, it is true,&quot; the man wailed. Then, composing
himself, he told of all that had gone before. &quot;They were at prayer,&quot; he said,
&quot;in there, in Mercier's mill. I myself and Prosper Roumilli,&quot; indicating one of
the men by his side. &quot;Also Antoine La Quoite and Pierre Delamer,&quot; nodding to two
others near him, &quot;were hastening to join them; all grieved that we were too
late. Late,  <i>grand Dieu!</i> What have we not escaped?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Death and destruction,&quot; whispered La Quoite, trembling.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, death and destruction.  <i>Hélas!</i> they raised their
songs of thanksgiving too loud. Their  <i>cantiques</i> told where they were,
reached the ears of that murderer there who was at his breakfast----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was,&quot; again interrupted La Quoite, &quot;with the woman, Léonie
Sabbat. A fitting companion. She can drink even him beneath the table.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Furious he left that table, summoned a battalion, passed
swiftly here, surrounded the mill. Furious, too, because as they passed the
cathedral he heard the organ blow, knew that Fléchier worshipped too, mad and
savage because during such time we should also worship God in our own way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet our day will come,&quot; murmured Pierre Delamer, &quot;it will
come. I am old, yet shall I not die until it comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The soldiers burst open the door,&quot; went on the original
speaker, &quot;rushed in among them sabres in hand, slew many. Yet this was too slow
for him----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was,&quot; exclaimed La Quoite. &quot;He said they would be three
hundred minutes slaying three hundred people thus. Too slow! He drew off his
men, closed the doors, set fire to the mill. You see the end,&quot; and he pointed to
the ashes of the ruined place, ashes that were also something else besides the
remains of the mill.</p>

<p class="normal">Again the first speaker took up the story, Martin feeling sick
unto death as he stood by and heard.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;From within there came the shouts of the lost, the piercing
cries, the heartrending shrieks. Midst burst walls, at windows, upon the roof,
we saw the death-doomed appear. Flying spectres, phantoms, upon them the wounds
the soldiers had made, black, singed by the flames. And then, O God! the sight
passed man's endurance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What next?&quot; asked Martin, white to the lips.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What next? This: With their new weapons, the accursed  <i>
baïonnettes</i>, the soldiers thrust back into the flames those whom the could
get at; those whom they could not reach they fired at. We saw them fall back
shrieking. Yet in God's mercy their shrieks ceased soon--there were none left.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But one,&quot; exclaimed the man called La Quoite, &quot;a girl,  <i>
pauvre petite fillette!</i> She escaped so far as to reach the ground unhurt, to
escape their blades, although they held them up as she jumped from the window,
so that thereby she might be impaled. But they missed her, and, running toward
Montrevel, she shrieked for mercy. Poor child, poor child! not more than
fifteen--than fifteen!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His lackey,&quot; struck in Delamer, &quot;had more mercy than the
master. He helped her to escape from out the hands of the soldiers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank God there was a man, a human heart, among them,&quot;
murmured Martin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, yet it availed little. The brigand ordered her to the
hangman's hands, also the lackey. The gibbet was prepared. Both would have died
but that a Catholic woman,  <i>une s&#339;ur de la miséricorde</i>, upon her
knees--Heaven's blessings light upon her!--besought him by the God whom all
worship equally to give them their lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And he yielded?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He yielded. He spared these two, though an hour later the
lackey was thrown outside the gate of Nîmes, his master bidding him go hang or
drown himself, or join his friends,  <i>les Protestants</i>, whereby once more
he might fall into his hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is one good piece of news yet to be told,&quot; whispered La
Quoite, who was a man of fiercer mood than the others. &quot;In the  <i>mêlée</i> the
soldiers sabred many of the Catholics unwittingly. God be praised!&quot; and he
laughed harshly.</p>

<p class="normal">And now the end of this day's work had come. Montrevel had
left the spot. Behind him went the dragoons and  <i>milices</i>. The butchery
was over. He should have been well satisfied with his morning.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet it scarcely looked as though he were so. His eyes glared
around him as he rode off, his hand clutched convulsively the sword laid across
his horse's mane. No wonder that they said afterward, when his recall came and
the noble and merciful Villars replaced him, that on that day he was mad as the
long-chained and infuriated panther is mad. He had met with nothing but defeat
and disaster since he had marched into Languedoc  <i>tambours battants</i>;
nothing but scorn and contempt and derision from the mountaineers whom he had
sworn to crush beneath his heel; had received nothing but reproof from
headquarters.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Baville must be somewhere near,&quot; Martin said to La Quoite as
they watched him ride forth from the scene of carnage. &quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know not; yet, doubtless, not far. And he too is mad for
the death of his loved one. God grant he is not close at hand; that none of us
fall into his clutches. He would spur Montrevel on to fresh attempts.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet La Quoite's prayer found no echo in Martin's heart. He
wished to find Baville, desired to see him, to stand face to face with him and
tell him that Urbaine was safe. For safe she must be even after this massacre,
safe even though in Cavalier's hands.</p>

<p class="normal">Had he not said that he knew for certain she too was a
Protestant, as they were--<i>une Huguenote!</i></p>
<br>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Note</span>.--Justice requires it to be said
that, of all the Roman Catholic writers who have described and written upon the
slaughter at the mill in Nîmes, not one has approved of it, or attempted to
exonerate Montrevel. In truth, this awful outrage was the brutality of a rude,
ungovernable soldier and not of a priest; and Fléchier, Bishop of Nîmes, was
loud in its condemnation. It led to Montrevel's recall and to the arrival of
Marshal Villars, who at last restored peace to Languedoc by the use of clemency
and mercy. Such peace was not, however, to take place for some time.</p>

<p class="normal">Also it should be stated that Baville was quite free from any
part in this matter, and that Louis XIV knew nothing of what had happened, nor
indeed of any of the terrible events which occurred about the same time, it
being the system of Madame de Maintenon and of Chamillart to keep him in
ignorance of what was being enacted so far away from Versailles. It has been
told that when he heard of the massacre at the mill he was observed to weep for
the first and only time in his life. He might well do so!</p>

<br>
<h4><a name="div1_26" href="#div1Ref_26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h4>

<h5>DOOMED.</h5>

<p class="normal">Remembering that his horse (which he would require ere long to
carry him to the mountains, since although, as he had thanked God again and
again, Urbaine was in no danger, Baville would doubtless desire him to obtain
her release at once) had been left in the stables behind the Porte des Carmes,
Martin made his way there. Went toward the gate, resolved to fetch it away and
place it in some more secure spot than the one in which several dragoons had
tied up theirs ere dismounting.</p>

<p class="normal">Reaching the yard, he found the animal; found also that the
dragoons must have preceded him, since now all their horses were gone excepting
one, which, by its caparisons and trappings, by the great gold sun upon the
bridle, the throat-plume and saddle-flaps, as well as by its fleecy bear-skin
saddle-cloth, was plainly an officer's.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A fine beast,&quot; he mused as, ere he removed his own horse, he
held a bucket of water to its mouth, &quot;a fine beast. Too good to be employed in
carrying its rider to such work as he and his men have been about to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he thought thus he heard the heavy ring of spurred boots
upon the rough flags of the yard, also the clang of a metal scabbard-tip on
them, and, glancing round, saw coming toward him a young dragoon officer, his
face flushed, perhaps with the heat, perhaps with the business that he and his
troops had been recently employed upon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Peste!</i>&quot; the man exclaimed as he came up to his own
steed and began unfastening the bridle from the staple to which it was attached.
&quot;<i>Peste!</i> Hot work, monsieur, this morning, what with the glaring sun and
the flames from the mill.  <i>N'est-ce pas, monsieur?</i> Yet, yet I wish those
heretics had not been of the feeble. It is no soldier's work slaughtering babes
and women and  <i>vieillards</i>. My God!&quot; he broke off, exclaiming, a moment
later, &quot;So it is you, villain!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What!&quot; exclaimed Martin, astonished at this sudden change of
speech and regarding him as though he were a madman. &quot;What!  <i>Villain!</i> To
whom does monsieur apply that word?&quot; and the look upon his face should have
warned the young man to be careful of his words.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To whom,&quot; the other sneered, however, &quot;to whom? To whom
should I apply it but one? Who else is there in the stable-yard but you to whom
it would apply? And if there were fifty more, I should still address it to you.
Also the word murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To me! Are you mad that you assault a stranger thus with such
opprobrium? Answer, or, being sane, draw the weapon by your side.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which is that which I intend to do. Yet I know not whether
you are fit to cross blades with. You! You!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will know it shortly,&quot; Martin said quietly, as now he
drew his own sword and stood before him, &quot;unless, that is, you have some very
tangible explanation of your words to offer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Explanation! Explanation! Oh,  <i>avec ça!</i> you shall have
an explanation. Are you not the fellow who sat on the bridge when De Peyre's
dragoons rode into Montvert after the murder of the Abbé du Chaila? Are you not
the man who led the attack on the Intendant's daughter, dragging her from her
carriage, carried her off to the mountains, to your accursed  <i>attroupés</i>;
doubtless assisted in her murder? Answer that,  <i>maraud</i>, and tell no
lies.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And even as he spoke he struck at him with the gauntlet he
held in his hand, muttering, &quot;I loved her, I loved her, and I will slay you.&quot;
Then said again, &quot;Answer ere I slay you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will answer you,&quot; said Martin quietly still--so quietly,
yet ominously, that, had the man before him not been a soldier, he would have
been well advised to flee from out the yard. &quot;But it must be later; when I have
stretched you at my feet for your insolence. You shall have the explanation when
I have paid you back that blow, when your soul is hurrying to join your victims
of this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His blood was up now. The abusive words of the soldier; the
sting of the heavy gauntlet still upon his cheek; perhaps, though that he scarce
recognized, the feeling of hate against this swashbuckler for having dared to
dream of loving Urbaine--all combined to make him resolute to kill the man
before him. Also the horror, the disgust, that every effort he had made, every
danger he had run, should be subjected to such misinterpretation, added to the
accusation, if any addition were needed, that doubtless he had murdered her. For
the first time in the course of this unholy war his weapon was unsheathed, about
to be used. It should not find its scabbard again till it was wet with this
man's life blood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have I been mistaken?&quot; the soldier said, astonished by his
words, above all by his calm. &quot;Made some strange error?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have. No greater in your life than that foul blow. Put up
your weapon before you, or I run you through as you stand here. Quick,  <i>en
garde</i>. I am neither 'woman, babe, nor  <i>vieillard</i>.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If it must be, it must----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It must!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Soit!</i> If you will have it so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The yard was large enough for any pair of  <i>escrimeurs</i>
to make fair play in, yet had it been smaller it would have well sufficed, as
the dragoon found. Found that he had his master here before him, a man in whose
hands he was a child; a fencer who would not let him move from the spot he was
on, except backward slowly to the wall. And that not by his own desire, but
because the iron wrist in front of him rendered resistance to its owner's will
impossible.</p>

<p class="normal">Sword-play such as this he had never known, nor an adversary
who parried every thrust as he made it, yet never lunged himself, reserving,
doubtless, all his strength for that lunge at last. Strength to thrust through
muscle and chest-wall the blade which would pierce his heart.</p>

<p class="normal">He felt that he was doomed. There rose before him an old  <i>
manoir</i> with a window high up in a  <i>tourelle</i>, a window from which he
knew that, even now, a gray-haired, sad-eyed woman--his mother!--watched as she
had often watched for his coming. Ah, well, he would never appear again to
gladden her. Never, never, through all the years that she might live. Never!</p>

<p class="normal">There was a click, a tic-tac of steel against steel that told
him his reflections were but too true and just, that the gray-haired woman's
chance of ever seeing him again would be gone in a few seconds now. Also he
experienced that feeling which every swordsman has known more than once, the
feeling that the wrist of the opponent is preparing the way for the deadly
lunge, the feeling that his own guard is being pressed down with horrible,
devilish force, that the lightning thrust will be through him in a moment.</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment he was saved, his agony prolonged by an
interruption. Two men--warders--had appeared on the roof of the gate, and,
seeing what was going on below, stood there watching the play of the swords.
Joking and jeering, too, about his incompetency in spite of the scarlet and gold
he wore, bidding him take heart; that soon it would be over; also that the pain
was not great after the first bite of the steel.</p>

<p class="normal">And disturbed, agitated, he but clumsily endeavoured to guard
himself from that awful pressure, knowing that the thrust must come directly.</p>

<p class="normal">Astonished, he found it did not do so. Instead, the pressure
relaxed. A moment later his adversary spoke to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Those fellows agitate you. Take breath,&quot; and the dreaded
blade was still. Soon both weapons were unlocked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are very noble,&quot; the dragoon said. &quot;I--I--no matter. Let
us continue,&quot; and muttered to himself, &quot;as well now as three moments later,&quot;
preparing for the death he knew was to be his. Or rather thought was to be his,
not dreaming that it would never be dealt to him by the calm and apparently
implacable swordsman before him. For Martin, his blood cooling as he learned how
poor a foeman he was opposed to, a swordsman unworthy of his steel, had resolved
to dismiss him, strike up his weapon and give him his life, with some
contemptuous words added to the gift.</p>

<p class="normal">Not understanding, however, all that was in the brain of the
man who, as a boy, had been sent across the Alps from Paris to the best
<i>maestri di scherma</i> of Padua and Florence to learn all they could teach in
the use of small arms; not knowing this, the other prepared himself for his
fate, seeing now that the men on the roof jeered and fleered no longer; instead,
stared with a look of apprehension at the entrance to the yard.</p>

<p class="normal">Started, too, at a voice which Martin heard, as the others
heard.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Strike up that man's guard,&quot; the voice cried. &quot;Secure him.
For you, Montglas, touch him not at your peril. Arrest the English spy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The voice of Baville! As Martin knew well enough ere,
contemptuously disarming the dragoon by a  <i>flanconnade</i>, he turned and
faced the Intendant. The man whose child he had saved, yet who now denounced him
as an English spy; who had learned by some means that he was a subject of
France's bitterest foe.</p>

<p class="normal">Behind him there stood six Croatian Cravates, part of the
Intendant's guards, swarthy fellows whose very name caused tremblings to all in
France, though they themselves had trembled once before Prince Eugene's
soldiers, and were to tremble again as Marlborough hedged them in with English
steel later--men who now advanced to seize the English spy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take his sword from him,&quot; Baville said. &quot;If he resists, knock
him on the head. Yet spare his life. That is mine to deal with.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment the glittering blade flashed ominously before the
Croatians; glittered, too, before Baville's eyes. Then the point was lowered to
the ground, and Martin spoke.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What,&quot; he asked calmly, &quot;do these orders mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mean?&quot; echoed Baville. &quot;Mean! You ask  <i>me</i> that? They
mean that you are in my hands. That to-morrow you die.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Upon what charge?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bah! I equivocate not with such as you,&quot; and he turned to go.
&quot;Nay,&quot; he exclaimed violently, looking round as Martin again addressed him.
&quot;Speak not. I require no answer. If you reply I shall forget that I am the
King's Intendant, shall remember only that you are the murderer of my child,
shall bid these men despatch you here upon this spot.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The--murderer--of--your--child!&quot; Martin repeated.
&quot;Of--of----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of Urbaine Ducaire.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You believe that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Believe it? I know it. This man whom but now you attempted to
slay, le Baron de Montglas, saw you drag her from her carriage, carry her off.
Enough. Answer me not. Take him,&quot; he said to the Croatians, &quot;to the citadel.&quot;
Then, once more addressing Martin, he said, his voice calm now, his tones
gentle:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To-morrow you will have your chance to speak, even you, an
English spy, you, the murderer of an innocent woman, will not be condemned
unheard. The Court will sit at the earliest moment possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What if I tell you that Urbaine Ducaire lives, is well,
happy? What then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As Martin spoke he saw the handsome face of the Intendant
flush, the dark olive complexion become suffused with a warm glow, the dark,
full eyes sparkle beneath their long black lashes. Saw, too, that he took a step
forward toward him, whispering, &quot;Lives--is happy!&quot; Next, turned away again with
a movement of contempt.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What then!&quot; he exclaimed, once more addressing Martin. &quot;What
then! What, you ask, should I say or do? Say it is a lie, such as you told
before, only of five thousand times a deeper dye--a lie such as the lie you
uttered when you proclaimed yourself a  <i>propriétaire</i> of the North. Shall
do that which no power on earth, not Louis' own, can prevent. Slay you as I have
sworn a thousand times to do if ever by God's grace I had you in my hands
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At the feet of the soldiers there was a clang--the clang of
Martin's sword as he flung it on the paved stable-yard.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bid your bravoes pick it up,&quot; he said. &quot;For yourself, do with
me what you choose. It will never be sheathed by me again till you have heard my
story before the Court you speak of. Packed as it may be, packed as all the
courts of Languedoc have been by Monsieur l'Intendant from the beginning, packed
by every one of your creatures whom you can gather round you, they shall all
hear to-morrow morning my story, if I am not done to death ere I can tell it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lies, bravado, will avail you nothing. Le Baron Montglas is
witness against you. Come,&quot; he said, turning to that person. &quot;Come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And he strode from out the stable-yard after bidding the
Cravates to follow with their prisoner.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet when he was alone in the house which he occupied at Nîmes
his mind was ill at ease. Ill at ease because, in the calm bearing of this
prisoner, in the contempt which that prisoner had shown for him and his
authority as he flung his sword at his feet, he saw something which was neither
guilt nor fear. Instead, contempt and scorn.</p>

<p class="normal">Also he had said &quot;Urbaine Ducaire lives, is well, happy,&quot; and
in saying it had spoken as one speaks who utters truth.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet how could he believe that such as this could be possible?
Montglas, whose life had been at this man's mercy as he entered the stable-yard,
had seen the other in the  <i>mêlée</i>, had seen him tear Urbaine from the
coach, lift her on to his horse, ride off with her. To what, to where? To death,
to the mountains where the Protestants sheltered. And, if further confirmation
was needed, had he not caused to be brought before him one who had escaped from
the massacre of the Château St. Servas, one who plainly told how ere the
Camisards attacked the castle disguised as royalists, this man, the Englishman
as he now knew him to be, had brought Urbaine there, to wait doubtless for his
accomplices? Also that very day he had heard, had been told by some who had
returned from Cette, that among the Cévenoles who had been on the beach waiting
for the landing of the English, this man had been recognised. His own spies had
seen him; there could be no possibility of doubt.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet if, after all, they should be wrong,&quot; he mused to
himself; &quot;if, after all, Montglas, the escaped one from St. Servas, the spy,
should be deceived! Or, not being deceived, Urbaine should still live! What
then? What if in truth he has in some manner managed to protect her, to save
her! What then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as he muttered these words, these surmises, he wiped the
heat drops from his brow. For--and now almost he prayed that this man might be
lying--if all were wrong in what they accused him of, if instead of leading
Urbaine to her death he had saved, protected her, all the same he was doomed.
Doomed beyond hope!</p>

<p class="normal">He had communicated with Paris, with Chamillart, with the
woman who ruled the King, had asked for information about this stranger who
stated that he was a kinsman of the de Rochebazons in search for one who was the
De Rochebazon himself, and not a week since had received in return his orders
from Paris. Orders written by De Maintenon's own private secretary to arrest the
man, to put him on trial as an English spy found in France during a time of war,
orders to have him condemned and executed without appeal--his nationality, which
was undoubted, to be the justification for that execution.</p>

<p class="normal">And again, as he remembered this, Baville almost prayed that
Martin's words might not be true, prayed that, if they were true and Urbaine
still lived and was safe,  <i>he</i> at least might not prove to be her saviour.</p>

<p class="normal">Her saviour! Yet doomed to lose his life at the hands of the
man who worshipped the girl, the man who, instead of doing that saviour to
death, should, instead, have poured out at his feet all that would have gone to
make his life happy, prosperous, and contented.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_27" href="#div1Ref_27">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h4>

<h5>HER FATHER, URBAIN DUCAIRE.</h5>

<p class="normal">It was in a great hall, or chamber, of the Hôtel de Ville that
Baville now sat, splendidly apparelled, as was ever his custom when assisting at
any great public function. Once more he wore his white satin jacket with, over
it, the  <i>justaucorps-à-brevet</i>, and with, upon his satin waistcoat, the
gold lilies of France emblazoned. Also his hat--which, since he represented the
King, he did not remove--was white and fringed with gold lace, his ruffles were
of the finest point de Malines, his gloves gold-fringed, his sword ivory-hilted
and gold-quilloned. The rich costume suited well the handsome features of the
terrible Intendant of Languedoc--<i>le fléau du fléau de Dieu</i>, as he had
been called. That superb dress, combined with his dark olive complexion, classic
outline, and soft dark eyes, shaded by their long lashes, caused Baville to
look, as indeed he was, the handsomest man in Nîmes that day.</p>

<p class="normal">Beneath him sat a group of men of the law. Three judges in
scarlet and ermine; the  <i>Procureur du Roi</i>, also in scarlet, but with
ermine only at his cuffs;  <i>greffiers</i> and clerks, as well as two men who
were termed  <i>abréviateurs</i> and practised the shorthand of the day, with,
near these, many other persons of importance in Nîmes. Sandricourt, the governor
of the city, was there, as also Montrevel, his fierce eyes rolling round the
Court as they glared from his inflamed face; Esprit Fléchier, Bishop of Nîmes, a
good and righteous man, reverencing deeply his ancient faith, yet shuddering
with horror at all that had been done in Languedoc, and was still doing, in the
name of that faith; and many more. For it was known to every one in Nîmes,
Protestant and Catholic alike, that to-day a man was to be tried who was himself
a Protestant, an ally of the Camisards in the mountains, an English spy who had
been one of those waiting on the shore of the Mediterranean to welcome the
English invader. Tried! tried! Nay, rather brought up for condemnation and
sentence without any trial to a doom which meant either the flames in the market
place or the wheel by the cross in the Cathedral  <i>Place</i> below the  <i>
Beau Dieu</i>, or perhaps the lamp whose post was highest. All knew this,
Protestant and Catholic alike; all knew, the former shuddering and the latter
gloating over the knowledge, that this was to be no trial, but a sentence; no
execution, but a murder.</p>

<p class="normal">The Court, or great chamber, began to fill with spectators,
also with those who were to act as guards to all who presided at or took part in
the proceedings. That guard would indeed be necessary, since none could say,
among those who represented what was termed the  <i>Partie Royaliste</i>, how
soon its services might be required to prevent them from being attacked and done
to death, even as, in Mercier's mill yesterday, they had attacked and done to
death those of the other side. None could say how, at any instant, sweeping down
from their mountain homes, from their impenetrable fastnesses and caverns, might
come the dreaded  <i>attroupés</i> headed by either Cavalier or Roland, with
their tigerish blood on fire to revenge the hideous massacre not yet twenty-four
hours old, or with a fierce determination in their hearts to save the man who
had been their friend and ally. At any moment a shout might be heard,
o'ermastered by the pealing of a solemn canticle from a thousand throats; at any
moment a psalm might break upon the ears of all, as it rose to Him whom they
termed the God of the Outcasts, even as, to the swell of that hymn, was heard
the clash of steel, the shriek of those who were in the avengers' grasp, the cry
of despair from those who fell before the avengers' glaives. It was well those
guards should be there.</p>

<p class="normal">They came in now, the fierce Cravates whose eyes gleamed like
dusky stars from beneath their heavy brows, whose faces were as the faces of
wild beasts that rend and tear others, not so much because rending and tearing
is necessary to their own preservation as because it is their sport and delight;
men from whom women drew back shuddering as they passed, and before whom their
fellow-men felt their blood tingling with the desire to measure themselves. Also
the Miquelets were there, the wolves of the Pyrenees who fought with their
short, thin-bladed knives, yet slew as surely as others slew with heavy-handled
swords or by shot of musketoon. Outside were the dragoons and the
Chevaux-Légers, even the humble militia of the province, proud yet half timorous
of the company they were in.</p>

<p class="normal">Scarcely could even Cavalier, the undefeated, have made his
way with his followers into that hall, or, being there, have done aught to
avenge the butchery of yesterday or to save the one who would shortly be doomed
to-day.</p>

<p class="normal">The guard set outside and in, every precaution taken. Those of
the citizens who chose to enter and were able to find standing room were allowed
to do so. They were a strangely assorted company. Some were of the class known
as the  <i>nouveaux convertis</i>, men whom misery and fear of poverty had
turned from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism, men who could not endure to face
the flames or the gibbets. These were mostly old--too old to seek the mountains
and fight for their lives and their faith,  <i>vieillards</i> who told
themselves that the only fire they needed was that of their own hearths to warm
their blood, and who persuaded themselves, though with many a tear dropped
unseen, that one religion was much the same as another. Yet by their sides came
others now who should have put their weakness to shame: old women brought up in
the same faith as they, yet scorning to change to save their skins; women who
now mouthed and grimaced at Baville as he sat in splendour on the dais which
acted as a substitute for Louis' throne, and seemed by that mouthing and
grimacing to defy the Intendant to injure them that morning. Also, too, there
came in shepherds and goatherds clad in fleeces of the Narbonne sheep that
grazed on the hills around, with knives in their girdles; men known to be of the
new faith, yet men who were safe to-day, since the butchery of yesterday would
not bear repetition. Even Montrevel knew this, knew that he dared take no
vengeance at present on those mountaineers who scowled at him over the shoulders
of his own scowling soldiers, and nodded to one another and whispered as they
glanced toward where he sat, while they gazed inquiringly into each other's
eyes, as though asking a question. What question? One, perhaps, as to whether it
would not be well to o'erleap the barriers and cut from ear to ear the throat of
the beribboned and bestarred swashbuckler who sat glaring before them! It may
well have been such a question as that.</p>

<p class="normal">The soft yet piercing eyes of Baville saw all who entered by
the great porte that gave into the chamber--<i>nouveaux convertis</i>,
mountaineers, monks and priests, prohibited Protestant  <i>pasteurs</i>, old
women and men, soldiers off duty, and some members of the  <i>noblesse</i> (<i>grande
et petite</i>) from the surrounding towns and villages. Those eyes missed not
one face, yet seemed, judging by the calmness that dwelt in his glance, to
observe nothing; a calmness that told no more than a mask or a marble bust
tells, yet only served to cloak a hell which raged within him. The unhappiest
man in Languedoc that day was Baville, the most heartbroken.</p>

<p class="normal">Ere the dawn had long been come, the Intendant, a prey to his
own thoughts, to his own self-reproaches, not knowing whether he had not
committed an act that was irreparable in handing Martin over to the judges as an
English spy, had left his bed and made his way to the cell in which Martin had
been placed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must see him,&quot; he whispered to himself as he hastily donned
a dark coat and cloak, vastly different from the splendour of the costume he now
wore in open court. &quot;I must see him, for I fear--O God, how I fear!--that I have
sent to his doom the man who has saved Urbaine. His manner, his words, were the
words, the action of truth. What hideous reparation may I not have made!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Thinking thus, musing thus, he had taken his way from the
apartment he occupied in the citadel when at Nîmes to the place where Martin was
detained, a room stone-flagged and built into the wall, and strong enough to
detain the most ferocious and determined prisoner who should once find himself
within it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Unlock the door,&quot; he said to the man, one of the local  <i>
milice</i>, who was appointed to sit outside on guard over the prisoner within.
&quot;Open. You know me, do you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, monseigneur, I know you,&quot; the soldier said, springing to
his feet and preparing to do as he was bidden. &quot;Yet will monseigneur venture
within? The man is, they say, a dangerous----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bah! Open.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And a moment later the Intendant was gazing down upon him whom
he had denounced to the law, the man for whose trial, a few hours later, he had
already issued orders and summoned the judges.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon a low pallet Martin Ashurst lay sleeping as peacefully as
though in his own bed in his far-distant home, nor was he disturbed by the
grating of the key in the lock nor by the entrance of Baville. He had slept but
little for some nights past, and his long rides and exertions had worn him out
at last.</p>

<p class="normal">Gazing down upon him, observing the fair hair and handsome
features of his victim, Baville knew that here was no guilty man capable of
betraying a young and helpless girl to her death. The calm and peaceful figure
beneath him could scarce be that of one who would descend to such villainies.
Murderers of the young and innocent looked not so innocent themselves! And if
any confirmation of his thoughts were needed, he had it now. Upon Martin's face
there came a soft smile; his lips parted and he murmured the name of Urbaine.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Urbaine!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Urbaine! My love!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Had an adder stung the Intendant standing there, or the
lightning stroke blasted him, neither could have been more terrible. His love!
His love! His love! Therefore he must have spoken truth when he said that she
was well, was happy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God help me,&quot; Baville muttered. &quot;Have pity on me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as he did so, Martin's eyes opened and he saw his enemy,
his captor, looking down upon him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What,&quot; he asked, the softness of his face all gone, his
glance one of contemptuous disdain, &quot;do you desire of me? Is my hour come, and
are you here to show me the way to the scaffold? Is that the reason of your
presence?&quot; and as he spoke he rose from the pallet and stood before the other.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; replied Baville, veiling his handsome face with
the end of his cloak, as though he feared his emotion might be too palpable.
&quot;But--but--I have judged you too hastily. I have learned that but now. Have
indeed misjudged you. All pointed, all evidence pointed, to one thing: that, by
treachery unparalleled, you were the betrayer of Urbaine--to her death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment the clear eyes of Martin, all traces of slumber
vanished from them, looked into the equally clear ones of Baville with a glance
that the latter could scarce fathom. Then Martin said, quietly: &quot;And you
believed that evidence? Believed that I, whom you had made welcome to your
hearth, had made known to your child, should do  <i>that!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Almost I was forced to believe,&quot; Baville answered, his voice
thick and hoarse, his eyes lowered to the ground. &quot;You were in the  <i>mêlée</i>,
the attack upon the escort. You were at the Château St. Servas, and she too was
there. After that massacre--I--I--was compelled to believe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you still believe?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; the other answered, his voice still broken, his eyes
still on the ground.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What has changed your belief against the evidence you speak
of?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You murmured her name but now in your slumbers, spoke of her
as your love. Is she that? Do you love--her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I love her. Before all, beyond all else in this world, I
love her.&quot; Then he turned his face away from Baville and whispered low:
&quot;Urbaine, oh, Urbaine!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The dawn had come now, saffron-hued, bright with the promise
of a fair day; had come stealing in through the  <i>&#339;illet</i> high up in the
wall. Through the cross of the  <i>&#339;illet</i> the morning sun streamed, also
throwing one ray athwart the features of the two men standing there face to
face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And--and &quot;--whispered Baville now, the voice, usually so rich
and sweet, still blurred with emotion, almost indistinct, &quot;and she
loves--returns--your love?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Has told you so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, with her own sweet lips to mine.&quot; Then suddenly, his tone
changed, speaking loudly, clearly, he exclaimed: &quot;Man, you can not rob me of
that! Make one more victim of me in your shambles if you will, yet, as I die, my
last word, my last thought, shall be of Urbaine. My recompense, her hate and
scorn of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no, no!&quot; Baville exclaimed, his hands thrust out before
him as though groping for something he could not touch, or as though to fend off
the denunciation of the other. &quot;No, no, not that. Never that. You must be
saved--for--for her sake. For Urbaine. She is my life, my soul. Sorrow must
never come  <i>anigh</i> her again. Already I have done--O God!--have done her
wrong. Enough. Listen. You will be tried to-day, condemned as an English spy;
the De Maintenon has said it----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The De Maintenon!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay! You are the heir to the wealth of the de Rochebazons--to
much of it. You are English. It is enough. Tried, I say, condemned! Yet you
shall be saved. Here, in Languedoc,  <i>I</i> am Louis.  <i>I</i> am France,&quot;
and once more Baville was himself, erect, strong, superb. &quot;It shall be
done--it--it--it; there must be no sorrow,&quot; he repeated, &quot;for Urbaine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You forget one thing--the Church.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Church! Bah! Theirs is a sentimental power; mine is
effective, actual. You must be saved. I am Louis, the King, here. Shall be
recalled for what I do; be broken, ruined. Yet,  <i>until recalled</i>, the
King. Go to your trial, but say nothing. Refuse to plead; that shall suffice.&quot;
Then changing the subject, he said eagerly, feverishly almost, &quot;Where is she?
Where have you left her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In the mountains. Under the charge of Cavalier.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Cavalier!&quot; Baville exclaimed recoiling, his face a picture of
suspicion and doubt. &quot;With Cavalier! Under the charge of Cavalier! My God! They
will slaughter her! And you profess to love her!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is safe; as safe as in your own arms. They will protect
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Protect her! Protect her! They! Protestants, like yourself!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, Protestants, like myself. And, as they believe, nay, as
they know, perhaps as you yourself know, Protestants like--Urbaine Ducaire!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Through the thick moted sunbeams that swept from the  <i>
&#339;illet</i>
across the dusty room, passing athwart of Baville's face, Martin saw a terrible
change come into that face. Saw the rich olive turn to an ashen hue, almost a
livid hue; saw the deep, soft eyes harden and become dull.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They know,&quot; he whispered, &quot;they know that! That Urbaine
is--a--Protestant? How--can--they--know--it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One of their seers, a woman, divined it, proclaimed her no
papist. And Cavalier has discovered those who knew her father, Urbain Ducaire.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_28" href="#div1Ref_28">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h4>

<h5>BAVILLE--SUPERB!</h5>

<p class="normal">There was a hush over the Court. Yet a hush broken and
disturbed by many sounds. By the sobs of more than one woman, by the shuffling
of many feet, by muttered ejaculations from those who strove to force their way
nearer to where the judges sat beneath the Intendant, and once by a ribald laugh
from a painted woman who leered at all around her and flung nods and smiles
toward Montrevel--the woman Léonie Sabbat. By pushings, too, administered by
brawny men who were possibly mountaineers to the Miquelets and even the
Cravates, since if they were the former they feared not the latter; they had met
before. Once an oath was heard muttered and the ominous sound of a blow, then a
girl's shriek of horror. Yet at last some semblance of order was obtained, the
proceedings were about to commence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bring in the prisoner,&quot; exclaimed the presiding judge, Amédée
Beauplan, a harsh and severe man who had sentenced countless Protestants to the
various forms of death dealt out to those of that religion; and his words were
re-echoed by the  <i>greffiers</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later Martin Ashurst stood before all assembled
there. And as he did so many women were heard to weep afresh. Perhaps his
handsome manhood recalled to them some of their own men who had once stood where
he was standing now. Alone among her sex Léonie Sabbat, who was eating Lunel
grapes from a basket, laughed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Tiens!</i>&quot; she muttered, addressing herself to an elderly
decorous-looking woman who was close by her, but who shrank away from the
courtesan as though she were some noxious reptile, &quot;<i>regardez moi ça</i>. A
fool! One who might have had wealth, vast wealth. Now see him! Doomed to death,
as he will be in an hour. I know his story.  <i>Tout même, il est beau!</i>&quot; and
she spat the grape seeds out upon the floor at her feet.</p>

<p class="normal">Baville's eyes, roaming round the Court, yet apparently
observing nothing, he seeming indeed supremely oblivious of all that was taking
place, lighted casually upon two persons hemmed in by many others. A man well
enough clad in a simple suit of russet brown, who looked somewhat like a
notary's clerk, his wig  <i>en pleine échaudé</i> covering the greater part of
his cheeks, so that from out of it little could be seen but his eyes, nose, and
mouth. An idle fellow, the Intendant deemed him, a scrivener who had probably
brought his old mother to see the  <i>spectacle</i>. For he held in his hand
that of an aged woman whose eyes alone were visible beneath the rough Marseilles
shawl with which her head was enveloped, and with, about her brow, some spare
locks that were iron-gray.</p>

<p class="normal">The pair were not, however, always visible to Baville even
from his raised seat; sometimes the movements of others by whom they were
surrounded--of a fat and gloating monk, or of a weak and shivering Protestant,
or of a crowd of gossips from out the streets--obscured them from him
momentarily. Yet, as the trial went on, they came across his view now and again,
the youth holding always the old woman's hand. And seeing that woman's hollow
eyes fixed on him always, Baville shuddered. He knew her now, from a far-off yet
well-remembered past; her face rose as a phantom rises.</p>

<p class="normal">That Martin, standing there, calm, almost indifferent, his
hands folded on the rail in front of him, should be the principal object of
attention in that crowded place was natural. For he was, as all knew, awaiting a
sentence that must indubitably be awarded ere long. All knew also that the trial
was but a preliminary farce leading up to the great  <i>dénoûment</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">That trial, such as it was, drew near to its close. Witness
had been heard; Montglas, who had seen Martin snatch Urbaine Ducaire from her
coach and ride off with her; also the one man who had escaped from the massacre
at the Château St. Servas; also the three men who had been present on the beach
near Cette and had seen the English spy hand and glove with the Camisards--all
had testified, Montglas alone with regret and emotion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You swear this is the truth?&quot; Beauplan said to him, looking
up from the papers on his desk before him. &quot;There is no doubt?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the truth,&quot; the young dragoon had answered. &quot;Yet I
would that other lips had had to speak. He spared my life but yesterday when it
was in his hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has led to the death of many others. Also he is an English
spy.
<i>Mes frères</i>,&quot; he went on, turning to each of the other judges and
whispering low, so that none but the silent Intendant sitting above could hear,
&quot;what is our verdict? We need not long deliberate, I imagine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Both those others fixed also their eyes upon him
acquiescingly, yet neither spoke. Words were not wanted.</p>

<p class="normal">Then Beauplan, turning his head over his shoulder toward the
man who represented the King's majesty, and seeing that he sat there calm and
impassable, statue-like, inscrutable, rose from his seat and made three solemn
bows to Baville.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We await permission to pronounce sentence,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pronounce--it,&quot; and Baville drew a long breath between the
two words. Yet the handsome face changed not. Or only grew more ivory-like--so
ivory-like that those standing in that hall, both enemies and adherents, cast
back their thoughts to their dead whom they had seen lying in their shrouds ere
the coffin lid closed over and hid them forever.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What does he see that blasts him?&quot; whispered Montrevel in
Fléchier's ear, and the bishop, turning his own white face to the inflamed one
of the great bravo, muttered, &quot;God, he knows, he only.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In the crowd beyond the railed-off place where the principals
sat the effect was the same. Among all who now fixed their eyes on Baville, the
greater number asked: &quot;What does he see?&quot; and glanced over their shoulders as
though expecting themselves to see something terrible.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can the dead rise?&quot; exclaimed one swarthy Cévenole who, in
any other circumstances than the present, would have been arrested for an
<i>attroupé</i> ere he had been an hour in Nîmes; have been borne to the earth
by the Cravates and loaded with chains ere hurried to a dungeon, so certain did
it appear that he was a Camisard. &quot;Can the burned ashes of our loved ones come
together again, the limbs that have rotted on the gibbets be restored to life?
Has one of those come back to paralyze him?&quot; And he laughed bitterly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Il est lâche</i>,&quot; whispered Léonie Sabbat through her
small white teeth. &quot;<i>Mon Dieu! il a peur. Fichtre pour Baville!</i>&quot; and she
pressed her plump jewelled hand on the shoulder of her unwilling neighbour as
she craned her neck over the balcony to observe the man she jibed at.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet he was no coward. Only his heart sickened within him. With
fear, but not the fear of either phantom risen from the dead or of fierce
Camisard ready to send him to join the dead. Sickened at the sight of that aged
woman who never took her eyes off him, who seemed about to address all assembled
there. For he remembered her. Recognised her face now beyond all doubt.
Remembered one night--how long ago it seemed!--when all the land lay under the
snow, and when, at the foot of the mountains the  <i>tourbillon</i> whirled down
from the heights above great flurries of other snow which froze as it fell, and
struck and cut the faces of those riding through the wintry storm as knives or
whipcord strike and cut. Recalled how he himself riding through the
<i>tourmente</i>, followed by a dozen of his guard, had to strike breast and
body to prevent this freezing snow from ensheathing him in its swift, hardening
masses. Yet of what account such memory as that compared to another which
followed swiftly in its train!</p>

<p class="normal">The memory of a humble peasant's cot, a man stricken with
years reading his Bible by the fireside, a child playing at his feet, rolling
about the floor laughing and crowing as it teased a good-natured hound that
endeavoured, unavailingly, to sleep before the crackling logs. Then a word from
the man, another from him--O God! how fearfully, horribly misunderstood! Next,
the room full of smoke and the smell of powder, the man gasping out his life,
gasping, too, one last muttered sentence, whispering that he, Baville, was
forever smitten by God's frown. And on the rude staircase that led from behind
the deep chimney to the room above a comely woman standing, the little child
clasped in her arms, her face distorted with terror, her voice shrieking that he
was a murderer, an assassin.</p>

<p class="normal">A comely woman then, now an old one and before him, there, in
the body of the Court.</p>

<p class="normal">What if she and Urbaine should meet? What if they had met?</p>

<p class="normal">The doomed man, the man upon whom Amédée Beauplan was about to
pronounce sentence, had said that Cavalier had discovered those who knew her
father, Urbain Ducaire. Was she one of those whom the Camisard chief had
discovered, and had she told all?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is he mad?&quot; some in the Court asked again, while others
answered, &quot;More like stricken with remorse or fear.&quot; Yet surely not the latter,
since now he repeated his last words referring to the sentence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pronounce--it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet with his eyes never off that woman's face.</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later and it was done; the sentence delivered, even
as it had been delivered again and again in Nîmes and Avignon, Montpellier and
Alais within the last few months by red-robed legal functionaries, and, in
countless bourgs and villages, by rough soldiers acting as judges. A sentence of
death by the flames before the  <i>Beau Dieu</i> of the cathedral, to take place
at the time ordered by the King's representative, Baville. The ashes afterward
to be scattered to the winds.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, as Amédée Beauplan's voice ceased, others were heard in
the Court, rising above all the noise made by the movement of the spectators
passing out into the street, by the orders shouted from officers to men to clear
that Court, and by the loud murmurings either of approbation or disapproval
which were heard.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will never take place,&quot; one clear, high-toned voice was
heard above all others to cry, &quot;never. Ere it does, Nîmes shall be consumed to
ashes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And Martin, turning as the warders prepared to take him back
to his cell, saw from whose lips that cry had come. From Cavalier, the man
dressed in russet-brown and with his features hidden by the long black wig.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps, too, Baville suspected who might be the utterer of
that ominous threat, for now he rose from his seat once more, again he stood
erect and commanding; except for his pallor, which still remained, he was
himself as ever.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Stop!&quot; he cried, his voice ringing like a clarion above all
the other sounds, the shuffling of feet, the murmurings and mutterings, and the
clank of sabres; &quot;stop and hear my words!&quot; And seeing that all eyes were turned
toward him, he continued, his tones as firm and unshaken as though the events of
the past hour had had no actual existence:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In this hall to-day are present--I know it well--many who are
rebels to the King's, to my authority. Men whose lives are forfeit even as the
lives of countless others have been forfeited. Enough! To-day they are safe.
This Court is open, but for to-day only. Let those rebels therefore take heed.
For so sure as there is a God above us, so sure as I, Baville, Intendant of
Languedoc and representative of his Majesty, stand here, those rebels who are
found in this city at nightfall shall follow the same road their brethren have
trod before them. You have called me the Tiger of Languedoc, and, by the
splendour of Heaven, a tiger you shall still find me. Till rebellion is crushed
forever from out this province, so long as I live, never will I spare one who
takes up arms against the anointed King of France. Now,&quot; and he sank back on to
his chair, &quot;begone all of you out of Nîmes. To-night I cause a house-to-house
visitation to be made--ay! a search from room to room. Those found here die.
Begone, therefore, while there is yet time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, without waiting to hear what answer might be made to his
threats by any in the crowd, he rose and, passing to the heavily curtained door
which led from out the Court, left them. Yet ere he did so, and even while the
attendants held back that curtain for him to pass through, he paused once and,
facing all there, gazed on them calmly.</p>

<p class="normal">A moment later he was gone; gone without hearing the curses
and objurgations muttered by many lips, the loud &quot;Brava&quot; which Montrevel gave
utterance to, or the little rippling laugh that issued from Léonie Sabbat's lips
as again she struck her unwilling neighbour on the shoulder with her white hand
and exclaimed, &quot;<i>Avec tout, il est superbe</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Had she seen him, however, the instant after the heavily
figured arras had fallen behind him, she might have deemed he was less strong
and masterful than she had a moment before grudgingly allowed him to be. For
even as he passed down the passage which led to the door at which his
heavily-gilt state-coach awaited him, an exact facsimile of that in which Le Roi
Soleil himself travelled from Versailles to Marly or from St. Germain to
Fontainebleau, he walked unsteadily and his white brow was moist and damp.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If she should have met Urbaine,&quot; he muttered as he passed
along the passage, &quot;or if she should meet her, and tell all!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>&quot;HER FATHER'S MURDERER.&quot;</h5>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have not yet decided,&quot; Baville said that night to Beauplan
as they sat together in the new citadel, &quot;when the sentence will be carried out.
Have my doubts as to whether I shall not release him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Release him!&quot; the other echoed. &quot;Release him! Such a thing is
unheard of. He, an Englishman, a consorter with the Camisards, a man under the
ban of Versailles! Surely you would not dare----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Dare!&quot; exclaimed Baville, though very quietly, &quot;dare!
Monsieur Beauplan, you forget yourself. Since I have ruled in Languedoc no man
has  <i>dared</i> to use that word to me before.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet,&quot; said the judge, a member of an ancient family in the
south, who had always rebelled against the authority of this stranger to the
customs, as well as the  <i>noblesse</i>, of Languedoc, &quot;though none here may
question your authority, there are those in the capital who can do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There are. But you are not of the number. Monsieur Beauplan,
I have nothing more to say. I wish you a good-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I understand,&quot; Beauplan replied, &quot;understand very well. And
your conduct is natural; also natural that there should be an exchange of
prisoners, that your child's release should depend upon his. Yet beware,
Monsieur l'Intendant! I was at Versailles two months ago, as you know,
and--and--they said----&quot; and he hesitated a moment while a slight smile came
into his face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What did they say?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That not only might a substitute he sent in place of
Montrevel, but of----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Baville! Is that it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The substitute to be, perhaps, Amédée Beauplan.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, that is impossible, as you are aware. In Languedoc none
can rule as Intendant who are of the province. Yet I warn you, if you set free
this man even in the desire to obtain the freedom of Urbaine Ducaire, neither
Chamillart nor Madame de Maintenon will forgive.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You mean well, doubtless,&quot; Baville replied, &quot;yet I shall act
as I see best. Beauplan, you have children of your own, also a high post. If the
life of one of your girls were balanced against that post, which should you
prefer to protect?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">To this the judge made no answer, leaving the Intendant alone
a moment afterward. Yet, as he sought his own great sumptuous coach, he
acknowledged that, much as he detested Baville, what he was undoubtedly about to
do was natural.</p>

<p class="normal">Left alone, the other took from his pocket a paper and glanced
at it as, before the judge had appeared in his room, he had glanced at it a
dozen times--a paper on which were written only a few words. They ran:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Urbaine Ducaire will be restored unharmed to none other than
the Englishman sentenced to death to-day. If he dies she dies too. Nothing can
save her, even though she is a Huguenot. Decide, therefore, and decide quickly.&quot;
And it was signed &quot;Jean Cavalier.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So,&quot; he mused, &quot;he was in the Court to-day, or sent this
message by one of his followers, knowing well what the sentence would be. Yet
the decision was made ere this paper was smuggled in here, God knows how! It
needed not this to determine me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He struck upon the bell by his side as he thus reflected, and,
on the servant appearing in answer to it, he asked:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How came this paper here which I found upon my table?&quot; and he
touched with his finger the letter from Cavalier.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was left, monsieur, by a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A woman! Of what description?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Old, monsieur, gray and worn. She said, monsieur, that it was
of the first importance. A matter of life and death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again, as the lackey spoke, there came that feeling to the
other's heart of icy coldness, the feeling of utter despair which had seized
upon him earlier, as he saw her face in Court. For he never doubted that the
bearer of the missive was the same woman who appeared as a spectre before him at
the trial--the woman who could tell Urbaine all.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where have they disposed the man who was tried and sentenced
to-day?&quot; he asked next.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In the same room he has occupied since he was brought here,
monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So! Let him be brought to this room. I have to speak with
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here, monsieur!&quot; the man exclaimed with an air of
astonishment which he could not repress.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Ten minutes later and Martin was before him, he having been
conducted from the wing of the citadel in which he was confined to the adjacent
one in which Baville's set of apartments were.</p>

<p class="normal">His escort consisted of two warders who were of the  <i>milice</i>;
nor was there any need that he should have more to guard him, for his hands were
manacled with great steel gyves, the lower ends of which were attached by ring
bolts to his legs above his knees. Yet, since they could have had no idea that
there was any possibility of one so fettered as he escaping from their custody,
the careful manner in which these men stood by their prisoner could have been
but assumed with a view to finding favour with the ruler of the province.</p>

<p class="normal">As Martin confronted the other, their eyes met in one swift
glance; then Baville's were quickly lowered. Before that man, the man whom
Urbaine loved, the man who had saved her life, who could restore her once more
to his arms--if, knowing what she might know, she would ever return to them--the
all-powerful Intendant felt himself abased.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who,&quot; he said, addressing the warders, &quot;has the key of those
irons?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I, monsieur,&quot; one answered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Remove them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Monsieur!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do as I bid you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With a glance at his comrade (the fellow said afterward that
the Intendant had gone mad) the one thus addressed did as he was ordered. A
moment later and Martin and Baville were alone, the warders dismissed with a
curt word, and hurrying off to tell their mates and comrades that the rebellion
must be over since the trial of the morning could have been but a farce.</p>

<p class="normal">Then Baville rose and, standing before Martin, said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You see, I keep my promise. You are free.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Free! To do what? Rejoin Urbaine?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, to rejoin Urbaine. For that alone, upon one stipulation.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is the stipulation?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That--that--she and I meet again!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Meet again! Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Instead of replying to this question Baville asked Martin
another.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was,&quot; he demanded, speaking swiftly, &quot;Cavalier in Court
to-day, dressed in a russet suit, disguised in a long black wig?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; the other replied, &quot;he was there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And the woman with him, old, gray-haired, is she one of the
dwellers in the mountains, one of his band?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay. Her I have never seen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She can not then have met, have come into contact with
Urbaine?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How can I say? It is a week since I left Urbaine there, safe
with him in those mountains. Since then many things have happened, among others
the horrors of Mercier's mill.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was not my doing,&quot; Baville answered hotly. &quot;Not mine;
Montrevel is alone answerable for that. I was away at the beginning, on my road
back from Valence. None can visit that upon my head. Yet--yet--rather should
fifty such horrors happen, rather that I myself should perish in such a
catastrophe, than that this woman and Urbaine should ever meet.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke there came to Martin's memory the words that
Cavalier had uttered to him. &quot;Ere she leaves us there is something to be told
her as regards Baville's friendship for her father, Ducaire. And when she has
heard that, it may be she will never wish to return to him, to set eyes on her
beloved Intendant again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Was this woman of whom Baville spoke the one who could tell
her that which would cause her the great revulsion of feeling which Cavalier had
hinted at?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why should they never meet?&quot; he asked, the question forced
from him by the recollection of the Camisard's words joined to Baville's present
emotion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because,&quot; the other replied, his face once more the colour of
death, the usually rich full voice dull and choked, &quot;because--O God! that I
should have to say it--because I am, though all unwittingly, her father's
murderer. And that woman knows it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You! Her father's murderer!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I.&quot; Then he went on rapidly, his tones once more those
of command, his bearing that of the ruler before whom stood a prisoner in his
power. &quot;But ask me no more. It was all a hideous, an awful mistake. I loved
Urbain Ducaire; would have saved him. And--and--by that mistake I slew him.
Also, I love his child--his!--nay, mine, by all the years in which I have
cherished, nurtured her. Oh, Urbaine, Urbaine,  <i>ma mie, ma petite!</i>&quot; he
whispered, as though there were none other present to see him in this, his dark
hour. &quot;Urbaine, if you learn this you will come to hate me as all in Languedoc
hate me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Be comforted,&quot; Martin exclaimed, touched to the heart by the
man's grief, forgetful, too, of all the horrible instances of severity linked
with his name, &quot;be comforted. She must never meet that woman, never know. Only,&quot;
he almost moaned, remembering all that the knowledge of this awful thing would
bring to her, &quot;how to prevent it. How to prevent it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have it,&quot; Baville said, and he straightened himself, was
alert, strong again, &quot;I have it. I said but now I would, must, see her once
more. But, God help me! I renounce that hope forever. To save her from that
knowledge, to save her heart from breaking, I forego all hopes of ever looking
on her face again, ever hearing her whisper 'Father' in my ear more. And you,
you alone, can save her. You must fly with her, away, out of France. Then--God,
he knows!--she and I will be far enough apart. Also she will be far enough away
from that woman who can denounce me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But how, how, how? Where can we fly? All Languedoc, all the
south, is blocked with the King's, with your, troops----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, the Camisards can help you. Can creep like snakes across
the frontier to Switzerland, to the Duke of Savoy's dominions. You must go--at
once. You are free, I say,&quot; and he stamped his foot in his excitement. &quot;Go, go,
go. I set you free, annul this trial, declare it void. Only go, for God's sake
go, and find her ere it is too late.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I need no second bidding,&quot; Martin answered, his heart beating
high within him at the very thought of flying to Urbaine, of seeing her again
and of clasping her to his arms, and, once across the frontier, of never more
being parted from her; of his own freedom which would thereby be assured he
thought not one jot, the full joy of possessing Urbaine forever eclipsing the
delight of that newly restored liberty entirely; &quot;desire naught else. Only, how
will you answer for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Answer!&quot; Baville exclaimed. &quot;Answer! To whom shall I answer
but to Louis? And though I pay with my head for my treachery, if treachery it
is, she will be safe from the revelation of my fault. That before all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When shall I depart?&quot; Martin asked briefly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now, to-night, at once. Lose no moment. A horse shall be
prepared for you. Also a pass that will take you through any of the King's
forces you may encounter on the road to the mountains. Once there, you are known
to the Camisards and--and she will be restored to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will they let me pass the gate?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let you pass the gate! Pass the gate! Ay, since I go with you
as far as that. Let us see who will dare to stop you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">An hour later Martin was a free man.</p>

<p class="normal">Free, that is, in so far that he had passed the Porte des
Carmes and was once more upon the road toward the mountains, toward where
Urbaine Ducaire was. Yet with all around him the troops of Montrevel, the field
marshal having sallied forth that morning intent upon more slaughter and
bloodshed, and with, still farther off, the Camisards under Cavalier in one
division and under Roland in another, descending, if all accounts were true,
upon Nîmes and Alais with a full intention of avenging mercilessly the burning
of their brethren in the mill.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, sweet as was the sense of that freedom, sweet, too, as
was the hope that ere many more hours would be passed he and Urbaine would have
met once more never again to part, he could not but reflect upon the
heartbrokenness of Baville as he bid him Godspeed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Save her, save her,&quot; he whispered as they stood at the Great
Gate, &quot;save her from France, above all from the knowledge of what happened so
long ago. Fly with her to Switzerland and thence to your own land; there you can
live happily. And--and--tell me ere you go that from your lips she shall never
know aught. Grant me that prayer at the last.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Out of my love for her, out of the hopes that in all the
years which I pray God to let me spend with her, no sorrow may come near her, I
promise. If it rests with me you shall be always the same in her memory as you
have been in actual life. I promise. And perhaps when happier days shall dawn,
you and your wife and she may all meet again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Baville replied, &quot;perhaps.&quot; Then from the breast of
this man whose name was execrated in every land to which French Protestants had
fled for asylum, this man of whom all said that his heart, if heart he had, was
formed of marble, there issued a deep sob ere he moaned: &quot;Be good to her. Shield
her from harm, I implore you. She was all we had to love. Almost the only thing
on earth that loved me. Farewell!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_30" href="#div1Ref_30">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h4>

<h5>FREE.</h5>

<p class="normal">The mountains again! And Martin free! Happy, too, because, as
the cold blast swept down from their summits to him as he rode swiftly through
the valley toward the commencement of the ascent, he knew that it came from
where, high up, Urbaine waited for her freedom and for his return. Knew it
beyond all thought and doubt; knew, divined that daily those clear, pure eyes
looked for him to be restored to her, was sure that nightly, ere she sought her
bed, she prayed upon her knees for him and his safety. Had she not said it,
promised it, ere they parted? Was not that enough? Enough to make him turn in
his wrist another inch upon his horse's rein, press that horse's flanks once
more, urge it onward to where she was?</p>

<p class="normal">Yet though he travelled with Baville's pass in his pocket,
though he went toward where the Camisards were, who would receive him with
shouts of exaltation and welcome, he knew that again he rode with his life in
his hands as, but a night or so before, he had thus ridden from the seacoast to
Nîmes. For there were those abroad now who would be like enough to tear
Baville's pass up and fling it in his face if he were caught, soldiers who
served Montrevel and Montrevel alone, men whose swords would be through his
heart or the bullets from their musketoons embedded in his brain, if he but fell
into their hands. For on this very night the great bravo had broken with the
Intendant ere he had quit Nîmes to march toward the Cévennes and make one more
attack upon the strongholds of the &quot;rebels&quot;; had sworn that ere Villars arrived,
who was now on the way from Paris to supersede Julien, he would wipe out those
rebels so that, when Louis' principal soldier should appear on the scene, he
would find none to crush.</p>

<p class="normal">Also he had sent forward on the very road which Martin now
followed a captain named Planque (a swashbuckler like himself) and a lieutenant
named Tournaud, in command of three thousand men, all of whom had declared with
many an oath that they took their orders from their commander and from no
governor or intendant who ever ruled.</p>

<p class="normal">At first Martin had not known this, would indeed not have
known it at all, had not his suspicions been aroused by finding that, as he rode
on swiftly toward where the principal ascent to the mountains began, near Alais,
he was following a vast body of men, among whom were numbers of the hated
Pyrenean Miquelets; men who marched singing their hideous mountain songs and
croons, such as in many a fray had overborne the shrieks of the dead and dying.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must be careful,&quot; Martin had muttered to himself, as he
drew rein and moved his horse on to the short crisp grass that bordered the
road, &quot;or I shall be among them. Where do they go to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, careful as he was, he still determined to follow in their
train, to observe what road they took when farther on in their march, for he
knew, from having been much in the neighbourhood a year before, and ere he had
set out for Switzerland on his first quest for Cyprien de Rochebazon, that ere
long they must take one route of two. If that to the left, which branched off
near Anduse, their destination would be undoubtedly the mountains; if they kept
straight on, then Alais was their destination. And if the latter, they would not
hinder him. He was soon to know, however, where that destination lay.</p>

<p class="normal">High above the chatter of the Miquelets and their repulsive
chants--on one subject alone, that of slaughter, rapine, and plunder
combined--high above also the jangle of the bridles, bridoons, steel bits, and
the hoofs of the dragoons and  <i>chevaux-légers</i> ahead, the orders were
borne on the crisp icy air: the orders to wheel to the left--to the mountains.</p>

<p class="normal">Therefore an attack was intended there, or what, as Julien had
himself termed it, when planning that which was now to be carried out,  <i>une
battue</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">That it would be successful Martin doubted. Never yet had the
royalists forced their way far up those passes, never yet had they been able to
possess themselves of one square yard of ground above the level of the valley.
And he recalled the treacherous drawbridges constructed over ravines and
gullies, as well as the other traps, which he had seen and had pointed out to
him as he descended from the Cévennes to meet Cavalier. He doubted if now this
enlarged attack would be any more successful than former and less well-arranged
attacks had been.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet Urbaine was there. That unnerved him, caused him to
shudder. For if at last, if now, at this time, success should come to these
troops, as both Julien and Montrevel had sworn it should come eventually, what
then of her! Those in command might not know, or, knowing, not choose to believe
that she was Baville's cherished idol. And to think of his beloved one in the
power of those fiends, the Miquelets, was enough to cause his heart to cease
beating.</p>

<p class="normal">Or, better still, to beat more fiercely with a firm
determination of seeking her than even he had experienced an hour before; the
determination to get to where she was before these heavily accoutred soldiers
could do so, if they ever got there at all; to join her, save her, protect her.
But how to do it! How! How!</p>

<p class="normal">How to get ahead of this band; how gain the ascent before
them, warn the Camisards. Above all--ay, that was it--above all, how save the
girl he worshipped and adored! That, or one other thing: die in the attempt.</p>

<p class="normal">He knew a moment later that the turn was made toward the
mountains. From beneath the tree where he had halted he saw, in the rays of the
now risen full moon, the sparkle of the breasts and backs and gorgets of the
dragoons as they wheeled to the left, also the glitter of aiguillette and steel
trappings. Perceived, too, that a deep silence had fallen on all that moving
mass. Even the Miquelets ceased to sing and chatter. Nothing disturbed the
silence of the night but the thud of countless horses' hoofs, with now and again
a neigh and now and again the rattle of scabbard against charger's flank. They
were in, or near the country of the insidious, unvanquished foe. Doubtless the
order had gone forth for silence.</p>

<p class="normal">He must get ahead of them--reach the pass or mountain road
before them. Otherwise, what of Urbaine if they should win?</p>

<p class="normal">But, again, how to do it!</p>

<p class="normal">To the left of him, and still farther yet to the left of where
the battalions marched after wheeling, there was a stream, a branch of Le
Gardon; in summer a swift-flowing river beneath whose gliding waters the reeds
bent gracefully; now half frozen and seemingly without current. If he could
cross that, there was on the other side a wide open plain, on which for
centuries peasant landlords had been endeavouring to cultivate grapevines, to
redeem from the marshy soil that was so common in the south some of the
thousands of useless acres which abounded. And across that plain, dotted here
and there by countless poles on which no vine had ever grown in man's memory,
and on which many sheep had browsed upon the short grass salted by the spray
(brought in from the Mediterranean on the wings of the Circius) until the
Cévenoles had descended and raided them, he might make his way, might cut off by
a short  <i>détour</i> that advancing force, get before it to where the ascent
began, be the first to reach the mountains, the home of the outcasts.</p>

<p class="normal">Only he might be seen. And then--then--though the heavily
accoutred dragoons would undoubtedly not be able to leap the stream and chase
him, the balls from their musketoons and fusils would perhaps reach him; one
alone out of the number sent hurtling after him might reach its mark. And that
would be enough.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet all the same it should be done.</p>

<p class="normal">The horse he rode was a strong black, handsome creature, its
nostrils red and fiery, its eyes possessed of that backward glance which tells
the horseman ere he mounts what he is about to bestride, its legs as thin and
agile as a cat's. Well, he would see. Now for the stream, fifteen feet across if
an inch. Then he found the animal knew what was meant even as his knee pressed
beneath the holster, even as his wrist turned inward to draw tighter the rein
and as he sat down firmly in the saddle. There was a rush upon the short, crisp
grass--crisp both from the salt of the distant sea and from the night frost--a
quiver from the body beneath him, a loosened rein now, a flight as of an arrow,
as smooth, too, and as swift. Then the animal's feet were upon the other side;
the rivulet was skimmed as though by a swallow. Over and away, the black steed
bounding like a ball beneath him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank God!&quot; he said, &quot;thank God!&quot; And, ere he settled into
the saddle again, patted the firm, iron-sinewed neck beneath his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">Off through vine poles, over another and a smaller rivulet
unseen by him for the moment, yet clear as day to the keen eyes of the noble
creature that bore him; off now parallel with the dragoons, across the
plain--parallel with the dragoons so dangerously near! And with over all, both
them and him, a cloudless sky and a full bright moon.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, next, a shout from that advancing force, a hoarse
clatter that all know and recognise who have ever heard firelocks wrested
quickly from saddle-rests, white smoke curling on the night air, spits of flame
from twenty different spots near together, puffs of bullets past his face, puffs
such as the droning beetle makes as it flies by us; a numbing shock against the
saddle-flap, yet on, on, on! The horse uninjured and still going fleet as the
deer, or even fleeter still, because of fear and nervousness. But still on, and
followed by a dropping fire that ceased almost directly. The musketoons were
useless by this time; they were out of range and he was ahead of the others.
Nothing could stop him now, the danger was past. Nothing, unless the horse
reeled in its stride, was wounded. Yet that he knew was not so, or else that
swift, even motion below him would have ceased ere this. &quot;Heaven be praised!
Where is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The night wind blew more piercingly as he felt the earth
rising beneath the steed. Far up he saw more and more plainly the burning lights
that burned near false bridges and declivities, to fall down which meant death
and destruction. The air was nipping even to those two whose bodies were heated
by their last hour's motion together. The ascent had begun. The horse breathed
more heavily now, threw out great snorting gasps from mouth and nostrils, yet
hardly halted, or only so far as to change from canter to trot and from trot to
walk. But still went on up, until at last one of the red flambeaux on the
hilltops was winking and flickering close by.</p>

<p class="normal">He was near Urbaine now. Another hour and she would be in his
arms.</p>

<p class="normal">At that moment three forms sprang lightly into the mountain
road from behind a piece of fallen rock, the moon showing that each bore in its
hand a firearm--a firearm raised and pointed at the advancing man and horse.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who goes there?&quot; one cried. &quot;Quick, your answer, or this,&quot;
and each weapon's butt was brought to the shoulder.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Englishman,&quot; Martin called out in reply. &quot;The man doomed
to death to-day at Nîmes for consorting with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So! Advance, Englishman. Yet in the name of the Holy One how
came you here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To seek for her who was my fellow-prisoner with you,&quot; he
replied as he got off his horse. &quot;Is she well?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is well--&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Behind. Up there,&quot; and he cast his eyes toward the summits.
&quot;She descends with brother Cavalier to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With Cavalier to-night! Is he back already?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, he is back, three hours ago. Now, to-night, he descends.
Nîmes is doomed. You would have been rescued by the morning. It was brother
Cavalier's second plan. He warned the tyrant, Baville, to free you at pain of
the girl's death, but  <i>tout de même</i>, he meant to have you out himself.
Yet,&quot; he repeated, &quot;Nîmes is doomed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But why, why, since I am free?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To repay the slaughter at the mill. Ho! Doubt not! That goes
not unrewarded. Nîmes first, then Alais, then Montpellier. 'An eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth.' It is our holy shibboleth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It can never be----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never be! Why not?&quot; asked the man who alone had spoken among
the three. &quot;Why not? What shall prevent the Lord's children from outrooting
their persecutors? Why not? You are on our side. Is it not so?&quot; and he looked
menacingly at Martin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do not know,&quot; the latter replied. &quot;Advancing here not two
hours behind me there comes a vast body of royalist soldiers in two battalions.
Among them the Miquelets. And, though they may never scale your mountain passes,
never reach the plateau, yet surely they will bar your way to Nîmes. Even though
your full force descend, they will outnumber you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The man, whom Martin remembered well when he was a prisoner in
the caverns and whom he had heard addressed as Montbonneux, pondered a moment;
then he said suddenly, with a slight laugh:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps they will reach the plateau. Perhaps we shall not bar
their way. One catches the rat by leaving the trap-door open, not by shutting
it,&quot; and as he spoke his companions laughed too, while as they did so Martin
again remembered the  <i>oubliettes</i> and snares prepared for any who might
wander up into the gloomy refuges of the
<i>attroupés</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ere he could reply, however, or announce his intention of
proceeding to where Urbaine might be ere setting forth with Cavalier, there rose
a sound close to them. A sound borne on the night wind toward where they were, a
sound that told him and them that down from their mountain home were coming the
Camisards. A chant that, rising above all else; spoke of revenge decided on, of
fierce unsparing retaliation:</p>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:10%">
<p style="text-indent:-8px">&quot;Quand tu te léveras, oh, notre Roi celeste!<br>
Pour délivrer enfin les élus d'ici-bas,<br>
Le vent de ton tonnerre à nos tyrans funeste<br>
En Balaiera le reste<br>
Au gouffres du trépas.<br>
Venge--Venge----&quot;</p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="normal">&quot;'Tis he, Cavalier,&quot; the man Montbonneux exclaimed, &quot;'tis he
who comes.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_31" href="#div1Ref_31">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h4>

<h5>BETRAYED.</h5>

<p class="normal">They had met again. Were together, never more to part unless
parted by one thing, Death! Death that was imminent at any moment, that might
overtake them that very night, or to-morrow, or the next day; for Cavalier was
on his way down to the plains to make those reprisals of which Montbonneux had
spoken. God only knew what might be the end of all.</p>

<p class="normal">She, riding on the captured little mule and enveloped in
costly furs--as usual, part of a spoil of a successful foray made by the
Camisards on a more or less unprotected  <i>manoir</i>--had seen him as the
large body of Cavalier's followers had rounded a point in the mountain pass,
and, springing from the animal's back, had thrown herself into his outstretched
arms, unheeding those who came behind her and the Cévenole chief, thinking of
naught at the moment but that he was safe and with her again, deeming all else
insignificant beside that one supreme mercy vouchsafed by God. For she knew in
what awful danger he had stood not many hours before; knew that, not more for
the purpose of exacting vengeance than for that of rescuing him, was this
descent from the mountains being made. And now he was safe, by her side again.</p>

<p class="normal">He drew her apart from where Cavalier stood with all his
followers behind him; drew her apart and whispered words of love and
thankfulness at seeing her once more. Then suddenly, observing on the fair young
face and in the clear, pure eyes a look that he had never seen before, he
murmured:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What--what is it, Urbaine, my sweet?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But she would not answer him, only contenting herself with
saying, &quot;Not now, not now,&quot; while even as she did so he saw beneath the light of
the full moon that her eyes were full of tears. Felt, too, the warm hand which
he held quiver in his grasp.</p>

<p class="normal">And as he noticed those symptoms of unhappiness he wondered if
she had learned while among these Camisards that secret which one at least of
them knew--that secret which, to prevent her from ever learning, had caused
Baville to bid him fly with her out of France, away, anywhere, so that she might
never know it. Never know that her father's death lay at his door.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; said Cavalier, approaching them and speaking very
quietly, after having carried on a hurried conversation for some moments with
Montbonneux and the other two men, &quot;come, we must move forward. Thank God, you
are free, out of the tiger's claws; for your sake and ours as well, if what my
followers report of the news you bring is true.  <i>Is</i>
it?&quot; and he looked piercingly at the other in the moonbeam's light.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is true if they have told you that a large force is making
its way toward these mountains. They must have left Nîmes some time before me,
since I followed them a considerable distance before coming up with their rear,
and I have outstripped them by perhaps two hours, though not longer, I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he told Cavalier that Baville had himself released him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Baville released you! Because of my threat?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because of----&quot; yet since Urbaine was by his side he paused
and told no more, or only with a look which Cavalier understood sufficiently
well, for he also now knew of the Intendant's part in the death of Urbain
Ducaire, understood that his love for Urbaine had grown out of his remorse.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; he said shortly, after meditating for a moment with
his eyes fixed on the ground, &quot;come, we must go forward now. Best meet this
force and check it, or part of it. How many strong are they, do you suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At least a thousand. Perhaps more. Composed of dragoons,
<i>chevaux-légers</i>, and Miquelets. Can you cope with those?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If we are united, yes. But Roland is away, ahead, with half
our men; yet, stay. We have to meet at the Tour de Bellot. If we can join them
before these soldiers reach that, then we can win. If not, if they catch
Roland's force alone, then God help Roland!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke, from afar off there came a sound that none in all
the vast band which had descended from the mountains could have mistaken, unless
it were Urbaine alone. A sound deep, muffled, roaring. That of cannons firing.
Heard first down in the valley, then reverberating high up amid the clouds that
capped the summits of the cold mountain tops.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You hear?&quot; he said. &quot;You hear? We must on at once. On, on!
What will you do with the lady? She is yours now. You see, I remembered my
promise. I was bringing her to you, knowing full well that either by threats or
siege we would have you out of the hands of Baville. Yet I thought not you could
have been free to-night, so soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My place is by her side forever now. Where she is, there am
I.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Be it so. Will you go back with her? Yet I know not, if they
gain the passes, the caverns will be surrounded and--and--if they succeed we
shall not be there to help or succour. God, he knows what is best!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can they do that, gain the summits?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Scarce can I say. Yet now at last I fear. The prophets see
visions, speak of rebuffs at last. The  <i>extasées</i>, the woman seers, the
female children--all foretell disaster. Even I, who have ere now believed that I
could read the future, am shaken, not in my courage, but my hopes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His last words were lost, or almost lost, in the dead muffled
roar that rose once more from far down in the valley, and as the sound was heard
again Cavalier started.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We must not tarry, even for her. Decide, therefore, and
decide quickly,&quot; while, as he spoke, he gave orders briefly to all who
surrounded them and commanded that they should be transmitted along the line of
Camisards which stretched far behind and up to where the great plateau was.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have decided,&quot; Martin answered. &quot;That firing is some
distance off, some five or six miles at least. At the foot of the mountains
there are many side-paths leading east and west. I can convey her by one of
those to some haven of shelter, out of harm. Let us accompany you to the valley;
then, Cavalier, we part.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do as you will,&quot; the other answered. &quot;I gave you my word that
all should be as you desired when you returned from Cette. I keep it to the
last. We part to-night forever. Remember me in years to come as one who was an
honourable man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as though he wished no more said, he gave another order
for the band under his command to set forth again upon its descent, and,
quitting Martin, went forward and placed himself at its head.</p>

<p class="normal">And now Martin took his place by the side of her he loved,
walking by the little mule, holding her hand in his beneath the richly-furred
cloak. Also he told her what was decided on as best for her safety. Once, too,
he asked, after he had informed her of the arranged plan:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do not fear? Are content?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Content! To be with you!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And the glance that rested on him, and plainly to be seen
beneath the ray of the moon, told more than further words could have done.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We shall be together forever and always now,&quot; he continued,
speaking clearly though low, so that she might catch his words above the deep
thud of the Camisards' tread as they swept down the mountain road. Above, too,
the roar of the cannon that grew louder as they approached nearer and nearer to
the spot whence it proceeded. &quot;Forever and always, once we are across the
frontier and in the Duke of Savoy's dominions. Man and wife,  <i>ma mie</i>, in
a week's time if we escape to-night. Will that suffice?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And once more she answered with a glance.</p>

<p class="normal">They were descending fast now toward the plain, yet, as they
neared it, it almost seemed as though the booming of the cannon grew less
continuous, as if the pauses were longer between each roar. What did it mean?
the Camisards asked each other. Was the cannon becoming silent because Julien
and his detachments had been caught in some trap, or had the royalist troops
been driven back again as they had been so often driven back before? Were the
outcasts, the  <i>attroupés</i>, again successful, still invincible? Above all
else, above that thud of mountaineers' heavy feet and the clatter of musketoon
and fusil shifted from shoulder to shoulder; above, too, sword scabbards
clanging on the ground, Cavalier's voice arose now.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Down to meet them!&quot; he cried. &quot;Down! Down! Faster and faster,
to join Roland and sweep the tyrant's soldier from out our land, or perish
beneath their glaives. On, my brethren, on!&quot; and as he spoke the tramp of the
men was swifter and heavier, the march of the band more swinging.</p>

<p class="normal">The plain was reached. They poured out upon it, no longer a
long, thin line, but a compact body now which marched not only on the straight,
white road that gleamed a thread beneath the moon's rays, but spread itself over
the sodden marshy lands bordering that road; went on swift and fast, while as
they almost ran they saw to the priming of their firelocks, and buckled rough
goatskin baudriers and bandoleers, wrenched from many a dying royalist, tighter
round them, and loosened swords and knives in their sheaths.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, as they went, the firing ceased or rather rolled farther
away from them, sounded now as if coming from where, beneath the moonlit sky,
the cathedral spire of Nîmes lifted its head. Surely, all thought, the enemy
must be driven back. Otherwise the booming of the cannon would not have ceased
altogether; at least would not become more distant, farther off.</p>

<p class="normal">And now they were near the Tour de Bellot, the rendezvous, the
spot where Roland was to have joined forces with them, if all was well. So near
that the solitary and lofty structure--once the round tower of an ancient feudal
castle that had stood many a siege in days as far off as those of the
Albigensian crusade, but on to which, in later years, had been built a
farmhouse, now a ruin also--could be seen rising clear and pointed to the
heavens; clearer than the more distant spire of Nîmes itself.</p>

<p class="normal">And Roland was not there, nor any of his force. One glance
showed that, long ere they reached it, the battle which had been going on for
now more than two hours was farther off than they had at first supposed.</p>

<p class="normal">The place was deserted, except for the shepherd who dwelt
within it, a man holding the creed of the outcasts, one who had also at that
time two sons in their ranks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where is Roland?&quot; demanded Cavalier of this man as they all
streamed into the place, leaping over the stone walls which surrounded the
pasturage and rushing hastily into grange and granary, there to snatch some
rest, even though but half an hour's, ere they might have to set forth again.
&quot;Where? Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Forward toward Nîmes,&quot; the fellow answered, speaking stolidly
and, as it seemed to Martin, who stood by, stupidly; &quot;toward Nîmes. He has
driven them back.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God be praised!&quot; exclaimed Cavalier and many who stood
around. Then the former asked: &quot;And followed them toward Nîmes? Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, I know not,&quot; the other replied, seeming even more stupid
than before. &quot;I know not. They are not here. The battle was afar. I did but hear
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We can do nothing as yet,&quot; Cavalier said, &quot;nothing. Can but
wait and abide events. Yet 'tis strange, strange that of all his force he could
not send back one messenger to tell me of his doings, his whereabouts. Our
rendezvous was to be ten of the clock; 'tis past that now. Strange!&quot; he
repeated, &quot;strange!&quot; And his eyes followed the shepherd searchingly as he moved
about preparing rough, coarse food for as many of the band as he could supply.
He had been warned that the descent was to be made that night from the
mountains, and also to prepare as much bread and wine as possible; and now he
produced all that he had, he said, been able to obtain without arousing
suspicions.</p>

<p class="normal">At this time Martin was standing beside Urbaine, she having
been placed in a rude armchair possessing neither pillow nor covering, which had
been set in front of the fire for her; and to them Cavalier now addressed
himself, saying:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For you to go forward now would be madness; nay, madness even
to quit this house and seek any road either to right or left. For--for--Heaven
forgive me if I am wrong, yet I misdoubt me of this man, one of us as he is and
the father of two others.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have Baville's pass; they would respect that. Would not
harm her. Even though the men in command have never seen her, they would
understand. And--and--it is imperative that I convey her across the frontier to
Savoy without loss of time.&quot; Then, drawing the banished chief away from the
close neighbourhood of Urbaine, he said in a lower tone, &quot;He dreads that she
should learn from any here that he caused her father, Urbain Ducaire's death!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With a swift glance the other looked up into Martin's face,
far above his own; looked up with a glance that was almost a mocking one.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He dreads that, does he?&quot; Cavalier replied. &quot;<i>Malheureusement
pour lui!</i> he dreads too late. He should have taken steps bef----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She knows it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Great God! 'Tis from that her fresh sorrow springs. How--how
did she----?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But ere he could finish his question there came an
interruption which prevented it from ever being answered.</p>

<p class="normal">Across the broken flags of the farmhouse kitchen there came a
man, one of the prophets, known as  <i>Le Léopard</i>, because of his fierce
staring eyes, a man in whose belt there was a long knife, the hilt of which he
fingered savagely, and on whose back was strapped a long military carabine,
another spoil of the enemy. And, reaching Cavalier's side, he muttered hoarsely
from beneath his ragged, dishevelled mustache:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We are betrayed. There has been no battle. Roland is not
within leagues of this spot. The cannon was a snare, a lure. And--and--come
forth into the moonlight and see what is without.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_32" href="#div1Ref_32">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h4>

<h5>THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH.</h5>

<p class="normal">From that old, dismantled farmhouse, built on to the tower,
there sloped down, toward where a small stream ran some four hundred yards away,
a long stretch of bare land, covered sometimes in the summer heat by short,
coarse grass, while in the winter time it was, if any of it were left uneaten by
the sheep, frost-bound or snow-covered. It was so now on this clear, cold winter
night, its surface being dotted by innumerable folds and pens into which those
sheep had once been driven, but which, since the mountaineers had been forced
into revolution and had raided the place, were empty. They were so on this
night, of sheep. Yet not of other living things, unless the moon played strange
tricks with the eyes of those regarding the pens. Instead, were being filled
rapidly with human forms creeping like Indians or painted snakes toward them,
wriggling their bodies beneath the hurdles they were composed of, entering by
that way into the ready-found ambush--the forms of the Miquelets, the most hated
by the Camisards of all the troops which had been sent against them; the men
whose extermination was more vowed and determined than the extermination of
either dragoon,  <i>chevau-léger</i>, or  <i>milice</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You see?&quot; whispered Le Leopard to Cavalier and Montbonneux as
they stood together sheltering themselves from observation behind the great
stone posts of the farmhouse's antique stoop, &quot;you see? They first, then next
the cavalry. Observe, beyond the stream; look through the trunks of the trees
across it. The moon sparkles on breast and back and the splints of the gorgets.
You see?&quot; Then added, &quot;And hear?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For from down toward where  <i>Le Léopard</i> had directed the
other's attention there rang that which told beyond all doubt that the foe was
lurking there; discovered them to the surrounded, hemmed-in Camisards. The neigh
of a horse, long, loud, and shrill, taken up a moment later by others in their
company and answered.</p>

<p class="normal">After that no need for further disguise or hiding. The
presence of the enemy was made known. An instant later the trumpets rang out the
&quot;Advance!&quot; Across the stretch of bare land the cavalry of Montrevel were seen
riding fast.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To arms! To arms!&quot; sounded Cavalier's voice on the night air,
it rivalling almost in distinctness the clear sounds of the royal trumpeters.
&quot;To arms! The tyrants are upon us. To arms! I say,&quot; and ere, with one wild
shriek in unison from the throats of the Miquelets, the latter sprang from their
ambush, the Protestants had leaped from the floors where they had flung
themselves and were in the open, face to face with the Pyrenean wolves.</p>

<p class="normal">Instantly the whole surface of the earth beneath the bright
rays of the moon was changed. Soon no moon was seen. The smoke from countless
firelocks covered, obscured her. Smoke dispelled for an instant now and again by
volleys of flame belched forth from fusil and carabine, flame that showed
Miquelets dashing at huge mountaineers' throats, their long knives in their
hands or 'twixt their teeth as they so sprang and clutched; that showed, too,
these savage creatures forced to release their grasp, hurled to the earth, their
brains clubbed out by butt and stock. Showed also the dragoons in the midst of
all, sabring, thrusting, cutting down, overriding ally and foeman
indiscriminately, reeling back themselves over their chargers' haunches as, from
the windowless apertures of the tower, came hail after hail of bullets from
Camisards ensconced therein.</p>

<p class="normal">But still the battle raged. Still from the Protestants'
throats rang their war cry, &quot;For God and his children!&quot; from those of the
royalists, &quot;For God and the King!&quot; from those of the Miquelets, in their hideous
shrieking falsetto, &quot;Guerra al Culchielo!&quot; &quot;Guerra al Morté!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Save yourself and her,&quot; cried Cavalier, rushing back for a
moment to the farmhouse kitchen and stumbling over the dead body of the
treacherous peasant, Guignon, who had been poniarded by  <i>Le Léopard</i>
the moment he was certain that the man had betrayed them, &quot;save yourself--and
her. There is a backway by the fosse to an ancient passage 'neath the old
castle; save yourselves. We are lost, lost! Outnumbered! Save yourselves!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then in a moment he saw that neither Martin nor Urbaine were
there. Gone! either to destruction or safety, he knew not which, yet gone. And
he rushed back to his doomed band; rushed back to see that the tower was in
flames, that all of his men who were in it were beyond earthly salvation.
Already it seemed to rock beneath the great spouting flames that leaped forth
from roofless summit and openings where windows might once have been. Doomed!</p>

<p class="normal"><i>Le Léopard</i> came near him at this moment, an awful
spectacle--bleeding from a dozen wounds, his vast and iron-gray beard crimson,
yet with his eyes glaring as ever. Came near, staggering, reeling, yet able to
gasp:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To the fosse, to the fosse! You can save some that way. To
the fosse!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come you also,&quot; muttered Cavalier, &quot;Come----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>I</i> come!&quot;  <i>Le Léopard</i> exclaimed. &quot;Nay, never
more. See!&quot; and he tore open his rough coat, showing on his breast a hideous
gaping wound. And as he did so he reeled more heavily than before, then fell
across the body of a dragoon lying close by.</p>

<p class="normal">But still, all around, the fight went on; the sabres swung and
the volleys rattled, while from the tower there rose now the death song of those
within it. Above all else that was heard a hymn of praise to the God of Battles,
the God also of the outcasts--a hymn blessing and magnifying his name. And as it
rolled through the fumes and the grime there came next an awful roar, a vast
uprising of a monstrous sheet of fresh flame, and, with a crash, the tower came
to earth, burying beneath its ruins not only those within it, but also many
others around, Camisards and royalists.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They are bringing their culverins,&quot; cried one now above all
the tumult, &quot;to play upon the house,&quot; and in answer there rang out now another
voice which all knew, the voice of Cavalier, the words he shouted being:
&quot;Disperse, disperse, my brethren! Children of the mountains and the clouds,
disperse as do the clouds themselves. Not to-night is our triumph, yet it will
come. It must come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He spoke truly. The triumph was to come ere long now. The
Camisards were to gain their cause at last, but it was not to be to-night, nor
by the sword. Instead, by the gentle mediation and mercy of one whose name is
still spoken gently in the Cévennes--the name of the great and good Villars.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can go no farther?&quot; Urbaine said an hour later to Martin
Ashurst, &quot;no farther. Oh, my God, my God, that it should come to this! And for
me, for my sake!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, dear one, what matter? We are together to the last. And
you love me. What more is there to ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alas! Alas! I can not live without you, stay behind alone. My
love, my love, you must not leave me. Shall not go before. If you die, then must
I die too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And as she spoke she loosened his vest and sought for the
wound in his shoulder which had brought him to this pass.</p>

<p class="normal">They had found the fosse the Camisards knew of in the old
farmhouse. Even as the attack began, Martin, seeking for a place of refuge for
her, had thrust open a door at the back of the great old kitchen in which they
were, and had led her out of the dangerous room that gave upon the spot where
the conflict had begun. Had led her on through a passage sloping down into the
earth from behind the house, until, by following it, they found themselves in a
place which none could have supposed would have been there; a place like a
crypt, stone-flagged, the stones themselves roughly hewn, the pillars dwarfed,
yet strong enough to bear a vast fabric above them; a place so old, so long
since built, that it may have been some Roman sepulchre, or hiding-place of
Albigenses in long-forgotten days, or secret chapel of worship beneath the old
feudal castle that had once existed.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet there it was, calm and quiet. Even the sounds of the
battle now waging in all its fury without came gently to their ears, was scarce
heard more strongly than the murmur in a shell or the breaking of the ocean on a
far-off shore. Calm and quiet, with, through a recess in the farther wall,
perhaps once a niche or shrine, a moonbeam streaming brightly and making the
dull flame of the lantern Martin had brought with him, snatching it off the nail
where it hung, burn dull and rustily.</p>

<p class="normal">And Urbaine, entering with him this haven into which they had
penetrated--surely none of those soldiers knew of it, would find it, surely God
in his mercy would not permit that--flung herself on her lover's breast sobbing
that they were saved again; again were saved by him whom she so loved with her
whole heart and soul.</p>

<p class="normal">Then started back, a look of terror on her face--a look of
awful fear and apprehension--seeing what she did see in her lover's eyes as she
sought them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God!&quot; she half whispered, half shrieked, shuddering,
&quot;what--what is it? Martin, my love? Oh, what--what has happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For his lips were cold, there was no answering warmth in them
as they met hers; his face was white as death, his eyes dull and filmy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It--it--is not much. But--I--am struck. As we left the place
above, a bullet--through the window--struck me. I--I--can go no farther. Alas, I
can not stand,&quot; while as he spoke he swayed heavily against the middle pillar of
the crypt, then slid, clutching at it, to the earth.</p>

<p class="normal">Even as he did so, even, too, as she a moment later undid his
vest to seek for the wound, there came to her ears, though perhaps not to his as
he lay there faint and almost insensible, the sound of many rushing feet, a
heavy trampling; then, next, men passing swiftly by and farther on through the
fosse--men whose smoke-grimed faces (sometimes, too, their wounded faces) she
recognised as the moonbeams flickered on them. Camisards fleeing hastily,
dispersing as Cavalier had said. The Camisards in whose power she had once been,
in whose company she had but a few hours ago descended from the mountains.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O God!&quot; she moaned, &quot;are they pursued by Montrevel's troops?
If so, and he, my love, is found here by those troops!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But he was not all unconscious; he could still hear, and,
hearing, understood that moan.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, dearest,&quot; he whispered back, &quot;even so it matters not.
The Protestants, these men, are our friends. Baville's pass, the packet he bade
me give you on our wedding morn--alas, our wedding morn!--will hold us safe from
the soldiers. Fear not,  <i>ma mie</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Baville! The name stung her like an adder's fang. Baville! The
man who had slain her father, and then endeavoured by a false, pretended love,
to take that father's place! The man she would never see again, had vowed, as
deeply as one so gentle as she could vow, never to see or know again.</p>

<p class="normal">Baville! And he had written to her, sent her a packet. Her
lover had it about him at this moment. What could such a thing mean? What
import? Yet, yet she upbraided herself for thinking of her own griefs and
sorrows now at such a time as this. Baville! Faugh! Baville! Yet if he knew to
what a pass they had come, knew that this man whose life might be ebbing slowly
from him now, was ebbing slowly, was here? If he knew that he who had saved her
was dying? Baville! The man whom once she had loved with a daughter's love.</p>

<p class="normal">Again the hurrying feet passed, again the gaunt fugitives went
by, yet she heeded them not. Her whole soul was in what she was endeavouring to
do--to staunch that gaping wound. Then suddenly one, an old, white-faced,
terror-stricken man with long gray hair, stopped, seeing those forms; stopped,
peering through the moonbeam that slanted down upon their faces; stopped, then
advanced toward them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Tis he,&quot; he whispered, bending toward the wounded man.
&quot;Martin! Martin! O Martin, my friend!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know him? Your friend? You know him?&quot; she whispered back.
&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His friend, Buscarlet, the inhibited  <i>pasteur</i> of
Montvert. Driven to the mountains at last, forced to abide with these unhappy
outcasts, but, thank God, not yet to draw the sword. No, no, not that! Never,
never! Only to pray upon my knees to them by morn and night to shed no blood, to
bear, to suffer all. To do that, I followed them here. Only they will not
listen. Oh, Baville, Baville, has not your tiger's fury been glutted yet?&quot; And
he gazed down upon the almost senseless form of Martin lying there, muttering,
&quot;If I could save you!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, a moment later, he spoke again.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who,&quot; he said very gently now, &quot;are you? Not his wife or
sister, I know. But what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment she did not answer, looking up at him, instead,
with wide, clear eyes so full of sorrow that her glance struck him to the heart.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was to have been his, am his, affianced wife. And--and--God
help me!--I am Baville's, that tiger's, adopted child!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You!  <i>His</i> adopted child, and Martin's affianced wife!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Even so.&quot; And she bent her head and wept.</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment there was silence in that deserted place,
deserted now since all the fugitive mountaineers had passed through the fosse;
silent because no longer was heard the distant sound or hum of shot or cry of
combatants. Then he bent over Martin, looked to his wound, touching it very
gently and afterward replacing the hasty bandages she had made from some of her
own linen, and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is exhausted from his loss of blood. But, though he dies,
it will not be yet. The cold is to be feared, however. If that reaches the
wound--I know somewhat of surgery--he can not live. Now I go to seek succour,
help!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Succour! Help! Where can it be obtained? In Heaven's mercy,
where? Nîmes is three leagues off.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will do my best. Pray God I am not too late.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And so he left her.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_33" href="#div1Ref_33">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h4>

<h5>TOUT SAVOIR, C'EST TOUT PARDOXNER.</h5>

<p class="normal">Coming to himself, Martin, lying there, wondered where he was.
He felt no pain in the wounded shoulder, only, instead, an awful weakness. Also
he felt no cold. Knew too that around him was wrapped some soft warm garment,
yet knew not that it was the great fur cloak in which the woman whom he had
loved had been muffled up as she descended from the mountains, and in which she
had long since enveloped him. Long since to her, watching, waiting there for
succour to come, through two, three, four hours, and then another, but to him no
length of time whatsoever. And he did not know--he was indeed even still in a
half-unconscious state--how those hours had been spent by her, heedless of the
cold which pierced through and through her, spent in sitting on the ground by
his side, soothing him when he moaned painfully, holding his hand, kissing his
hot brow. Attending also to his wound, and going even some distance farther
along the fosse in the hope of discovering water, yet without success.</p>

<p class="normal">He knew nothing; had forgotten how he came there, that she had
been with him, that there was such a woman, and that they loved each other
madly.</p>

<p class="normal">Then suddenly a voice broke in upon his unconsciousness--a
voice that seemed to recall him back to the world--the voice of Urbaine, yet, as
she spoke, stifled now and again by sobs.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Better,&quot; it seemed to him that he heard her say, &quot;better have
slain me with him, upon his desolate hearth, than have spared me to learn this
at last. Of you, you whom I worshipped, whom I so reverenced.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">If he had doubted whether he lived or was already in the
shades leading to another world, or in that world itself, he doubted no longer,
when through that old crypt a second voice sounded, one known to him as well as
Urbaine's was known--a voice deep, solemn, beautiful. Broken, too, as hers had
been, yet sweet as music still.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; that voice said, &quot;you had escaped with your lover to
some far-distant land as I hoped, ay, as even such as I dared to pray that you
might do, you would have learned all. In those papers I sent by him you love,
you would have known all on the morning you became his wife. Now I must tell you
with my own lips. Urbaine, in memory of the happy years gone by, the years when
you grew from childhood to womanhood by my side, at my knee, hear my
justification, let me speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was Baville.</p>

<p class="normal">Baville! Her father's murderer there! Face to face with
Urbaine once more!</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment the silence was intense, or broken only by the
woman's sobs. Then from her lips he heard the one word &quot;Speak&quot; uttered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Urbaine, your father died through me, though not by my will,
not by my hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I loved Urbain Ducaire,&quot; the rich, full voice went on. &quot;Loved
him, pitied him too, knowing something, though not all, of his past life. Knew
that he, a Huguenot, was doomed if he stayed here in Languedoc, stranger though
he was, for his nature was too noble to conceal aught; he was a Catholic who had
renounced his ancient faith, a  <i>nouveau converti</i>, yet of the wrong side
for his future tranquility. And he boasted of it loudly, openly. He was doomed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again there was a pause broken only by the weeping of Urbaine.
Then once more Baville continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I beseeched him to go, to leave the neighbourhood, to depart
in peace. Provided him with safe conducts, implored him to seek an asylum in
England or Holland where those of his newly adopted creed were safe. He refused.
Your mother, a woman of the province, had died in giving birth to you. He swore
he would not leave the place where her body lay. He defied me, bade me do my
worst.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And--and----&quot; Urbaine sobbed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And the orders came from Paris. From Louvois, then alive, and
Madame de Maintenon. '<i>Saccagez tous!</i>' they wrote. 'Those who will not
recant must be exterminated.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then I sent to him by a trusty hand a copy of those orders. I
bade him fly at once, since even I could not save him. Told him that on a fixed
night--great God! it was the night ere Christmas, the night when the priests bid
us have our hearts full of love and mercy for each other--I  <i>must</i> be at
his cottage with my Cravates. He was a marked man; also I was known to favour
him. If I did so now, spared him and imprisoned others, all the south would be
in a tumult.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again Baville paused. Again went on:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I never deemed I should find him; would have sworn he must be
gone ere I reached his house. Yet went there, knowing that I dared not omit him.
Went there, praying, as not often I have prayed, that it would be empty,
forsaken. Alas! Alas! Alas! he had ignored my warning, my beseechings. He  <i>
was</i> there, reading his Bible. He defied me. By his hand he had a pistol.
Seeing the Cravates behind me, their musketoons ready, it seemed as though he
was about to use it. Raised it, pointed it at me, covered my breast.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The pause was longer now. Martin, hearing, understanding all,
his mind and memory returned to him, thought Baville dreaded to continue. Yet it
was not so. The full clear tones reached his ear again:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I could not deem him base enough to do that, to shoot me down
like a dog, since I had drawn no weapon of my own. It was, I have divined since,
the soldiers whom he defied. Yet in my contempt for what I thought his idle
threat, I cried scornfully '<i>Tirez donc</i>.' Alas, ah, God! the fatal error
that has forever darkened your life and mine! Those words were misunderstood.
The Cravates misunderstood them, believed the exclamation an order given to them
by me; a moment later they had fired. O Urbaine! my love, my child--I--I--what
more is there to tell?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And as he ceased, hers were not the only sobs Martin heard
now.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as they too ceased somewhat, another voice was heard by
the listener--the voice of Buscarlet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You hear? The wrong, that was in truth no wrong, is atoned.
Has never been. Your way is clear before you. The evil he has wrought has not
come nigh you or yours. Woman, as his heart has ever cherished you, I, a pastor
of your rightful faith, bid you give back your love to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The dawn was coming as the old man spake these words. In the
thin light of that new morning which crept in from where the moon's ray had
shone through the night, Martin, his fur covering tossed from off him long
since, saw Urbaine fall on Baville's breast, heard her whisper, &quot;My father, oh,
my father!&quot; Knew, too, that they were reconciled, the past forgotten. And
thanked God that it was so.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet once again Buscarlet spoke, his white hair gleaming in the
light of the coming day, his old form erect and stately before the other.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are absolved by her,&quot; he said; &quot;earn absolution, too, for
your past cruelty by greater mercy to others of her faith. I charge you, I, a
priest of that persecuted faith, that henceforth you persecute no more. God has
given you back your child's love. Be content.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">A little later and those three were gathered round the spot
where Martin lay, with, in the background, a fourth figure, that of Baville's
own surgeon. He had been brought by the Intendant after Buscarlet had told the
latter all that he had ridden hastily to Nîmes to inform him of, and when the
pastor had declared that if surgical aid was not at once forthcoming the wounded
man must surely die. And, seeing him, the surgeon had said that his life still
hung in the balance; that if what Baville desired was to be done, it had best be
done at once.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will make you happy?&quot; Urbaine whispered, her lips close to
her lover's, her arms about him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Passing happy,&quot; he murmured, &quot;beyond all hope. Now, now, at
once.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can do it?&quot; the Intendant asked, turning to the pastor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can do it now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So! Let it be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Stay there by his side,&quot; Buscarlet said then to Urbaine,
&quot;upon your knees.--Take you her hand,&quot; to Martin.</p>

<p class="normal">And in whispered tones he commenced the marriage ceremony of
the Huguenots as prescribed by their Church.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Repeat after me that you take Urbaine Ducaire to be your
wedded wife&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; said Baville, interposing. &quot;Nay, I had forgotten.
Not that. Not that. The packet would have told what both must have learned ere
they had been married elsewhere. Now I must tell it myself. Her name is not
Urbaine Ducaire.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not Urbaine Ducaire?&quot; all exclaimed, looking up at him. &quot;Not
Urbaine Ducaire?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay. Nor her father's Urbain Ducaire. Instead, this,&quot; and he
produced hastily his tablets from his pocket and wrote on them for some few
moments, muttering as he did so, &quot;I knew it not till lately, until I
communicated with those in Paris, though I suspected. Also,&quot; he repeated, &quot;the
packet would have told all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, thrusting the tablets into the pastor's hands, while all
around still gazed incredulously at him, he said aloud: &quot;Marry her in those
names and titles. Hers by right which none can dispute, and by the law of
Richelieu passed through the Parliament of Paris in the last year of his life.
The right of sole daughters where no male issue exists.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;These titles are lawfully hers?&quot; Buscarlet asked, reading in
astonishment that which Baville had written, while Urbaine clung closer still to
her lover, wondering what further mystery surrounded her birth, and Martin, no
light breaking in on him as yet, deeming Baville demented. &quot;Lawfully hers?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lawfully, absolutely hers. Proceed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And again Buscarlet commenced:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Repeat after me that you take Cyprienne, Urbaine
Beauvilliers----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God!&quot; whispered Martin faintly ere he did so. &quot;My God!
that my quest ends here!&quot; Then he repeated the words that Buscarlet read from
Baville's tablets as he had been bidden.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Baronne de Beauvilliers,&quot; the pastor continued, &quot;Comtesse de
Montrachet, Marquise du Gast d'Ançilly, Princesse de Rochebazon, daughter of
Cyprien, Urbain Beauvilliers, former bearer of those titles, to be your wedded
wife--to----&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">It was finished. They were married. The union blessed by a
pastor of their own Church and attested by him who had so persecuted the members
of that Church by order of the man, if indeed it was by his orders, whom they
called &quot;The Scourge of God.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And Martin, gazing up into the eyes of his wife, murmured:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have not failed, my love, in what I sought. But, ah, that
my search should bring me to such perfect peace, should end with you! Now, if I
die, I die happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But even as she held him close to her, his head upon her
shoulder, he knew, felt sure, that he would not die; that God would restore him
to a new life, to be passed as long as it lasted by her side.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Postscript</span>.--The historical incidents
in the foregoing story have necessarily, for obvious purposes in one or two
instances, been altered from their exact sequence. With this exception they are
described precisely as they occurred, each description being taken from the best
authorities, and especially the best local ones. Exclusive of the names of
Ashurst, Ducaire, and all pertaining to that of De Rochebazon and of De
Rochebazon itself, the others are, in almost every case, authentic.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
